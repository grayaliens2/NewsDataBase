23,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/05/opinions/devos-racism-public-school-opinion-wong/index.html,A vote for DeVos is a vote for resegregation,Felicia Wong is President and CEO of the Roosevelt Institute an economic and social policy think tank working to reimagine the rules so they work for all Americans and coauthor of the forthcoming book Rewrite the Racial Rules Building an Inclusive American Economy Randi Weingarten President of the American Federation of Teachers is on Roosevelts board The views expressed in this commentary are her ownThe limited scope of DeVos education policy experience has raised questions for many about whether she is suited to run the federal agency charged with making American public education firstrate for all children But there is another subterranean element to this debate which now should be surfaced especially given our racially charged environment and the role that segregated schools have long played in our politics Racial animus was a primary catalyst of the move toward private and religious K12 education almost 50 years ago and racial segregation remains a dominant factor in all schooling public and private today DeVos track record suggests that as secretary she will do little to combat these trends In the wake of the 1954 Brown v Board Supreme Court decision which famously declared that separate schools for black and white children were not equal the federal government began albeit slowly to desegregate This applied to schools in the South that were previously forbidden by law from educating children of different races together and to schools in the North plagued by de facto segregation The backlash now infamous but perhaps too familiar even today was fierce From Alabama Governor George Wallaces stance in the schoolhouse door and his proclamations of segregation now segregation forever to Louise Day Hicks leading the Boston antibusing movement the reaction to desegregation roiled American politics But the Brown ruling did not apply to private schools Thus an estimated halfmillion white students left public schools between 1964 and 1975 to enroll in schools that were known as segregation academies This move to private schools was part of a larger white flight movement White flight was one of the greatest demographic shifts in American history Millions of whites nationwide moved out of cities and into racially isolated suburbs Scholar Kevin Kruse has called white flight the most successful segregationist response to the moral demands of the civil rights movement and the legal authority of the courts The character and quality of most American schools today like the neighborhoods in which they are found and which they shape have a racial past Now American public schools are falling back into a kind of racial segregation that is reminiscent of our country before Brown In the last 25 years the number of severely racially isolated schools defined as those with 010 white students has tripled In 2010 in New York City 92 of black students and 88 of Latino students attended schools that were majorityminority some of which see such severely racialized and concentrated poverty that they are dubbed apartheid schools In DeVoss own state of Michigan which has seen two decades of charter school growth enrollment and funding for public schools has waned while schools have become increasingly segregated Nor does public funding for private schools which DeVos advocates seem to achieve much good for students of color Voucher and other public funding programs are marketed as appealing because tax dollars follow the child But research over the past fifteen years shows that private schools are even more racially segregated than public schools This has negative consequences for both white students and students of color Research shows that both black children who attend desegregated schools end up with more income higher wages and better longterm health with no negative effects on white students Further a range of studies strongly suggest that desegregated schools educate all children such that they can better contribute to American society and to a healthier American economy It is therefore both a moral outrage and an economic mistake that so much of the current movement in favor of school choice and religious education carries the stain of racial animosity even in dogwhistle form Of course many private and religious schools are excellent and inclusive places of learning But lets not be fooled School choice is not really about freedom Freedom of course is a bedrock American value But the kind of freedom associated with the flight away from integration and toward racial isolation will never lead to a more truly free United States So as senators consider DeVos nomination to oversee public education for every American child they would do well to remember the deepest values of public schooling as well as the deeper meaning of appointing a Secretary of Education associated with a more exclusive and racially exclusionary vision

26,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/trump-japan-shinzo-abe-mar-a-lago/index.html,Trump teeing up a softer diplomatic approach with Japan,Washington CNNPresident Donald Trump is turning on the charm Or at least hes turning on his golf cartAfter a combative round of telephone diplomacy with even the staunchest US allies the commander in chief is planning a more genial approach this week when he decamps with Japans Prime Minister to his winter getaway in Florida for a round of golf Hes not likely to instruct Shinzo Abe how to dance the CottonEyed Joe the way George W Bush did when Vladimir Putin visited his Crawford Texas ranch Nor is he hoping to replicate the courtside broout Barack Obama enjoyed with David Cameron at a March Madness game in Ohio But in bringing Abe to his ornate southern retreat MaraLago Trump is nonetheless continuing a long tradition of presidents melding recreation and negotiation in their encounters with foreign leaders Trump who is still seeking his diplomatic footing three weeks into his term finds himself more relaxed at his oceanfront oasis than in the White House where hes lived for less than a month He hopes the gesture will also put the buttonedup Abe at ease Thats the one thing about golf you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch Trump told a radio interviewer over the weekend The President has told aides he hopes to use golf and visits to MaraLago as a way to develop warmer ties with his foreign counterparts many of whom are approaching his presidency with uncertainty Trump who prefers to sleep in his own bed has expressed little interest so far in traveling abroad though hes committed to attending a European NATO summit in May and accepted an invitation from Britains Queen Elizabeth II for a state visit this summer RELATED Theresa May in trouble over Trumps UK state visit invite At MaraLago Trump is happy to play host Overlooking the Atlantic on Floridas Gold Coast the club is firmly Trumps turf On his first trip there as president last weekend he mingled in the clubs living room with paying members even as a Washington state judge halted his controversial immigration order Friends say Trump is most relaxed in the confines of his estate or playing golf on the courses he owns nearby Hes able to relax on the golf course with people he knows and trusts and likes said Robin Bernstein one of MaraLagos original members who speaks with Trump frequently when hes staying in Florida I think that he finds golf kind of his outlet to relax He loves it he enjoys it hes a fabulous athlete and thats what he loves Some people go fishing Donald loves golf In Abe Trump finds a leader eager to foster a closer bond with the US particularly given Trumps tough criticism of the TransPacific Partnership trade agreement which Japan was a partner in and the costs of US security support provided to the East Asian nation This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday after detailing the weekend trip Abe enjoyed a congenial working relationship with Obama but the two men never developed warm personal ties When Abe tried bringing Obama to Tokyos best sushi restaurant in 2014 the US president grew restless as the dinner stretched for hours Abe is hoping to start fresh with Trump already meeting once with the real estate mogul in November The pair discussed bilateral ties in Trumps Louis XIVstyle livingroom at Trump Tower in Manhattan Abe brought along a goldcolored golf driver as a gift I know he loves the game and were going to have a lot of fun Trump said in the radio interview this week Ill just make sure hes my partner Trumps invitation for a weekend at his private club continues a wellestablished practice of vacation diplomacy for US presidents His predecessors have acted both as hosts for their foreign counterparts and as guests at vacation spots and golf courses the world over But no recent president has owned as lavish a getaway home as Trump or been so eager to show it off Obama who maintained a residence in Chicago but rarely visited there himself employed public properties instead to host foreign leaders away from the White House Obama invited the new Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Sunnylands estate in Southern California for their first meeting including a long ramble in scalding desert heat around the grounds He used Camp David the presidential retreat in Marylands Catoctin Mountains to reassure Arab Gulf leaders of his Iran nuclear deal in 2015 Accustomed to more lavish environs leaders like Saudi King Salman sent top advisers instead More relaxing were his encounters with Cameron After Obama flew him to Dayton for the NCAA tournament in 2012 Cameron reciprocated with a round of golf at the Grove Club in Hertfordshire He was one of the few foreign leaders who joined Obama for golf others included the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Malaysia Bush who swore off golf shortly after the start of the Iraq War hosted more than a dozen leaders among the scrub brush at his Crawford ranch His threeday summit there with Putin in 2001 featured line dancing and a barbecue but little agreement on missile defense A session with the Saudi King resulted in some awkward photos of the President holding the Gulf monarchs hand Bill Clinton used Camp David to try securing an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at the end of his term He wasnt successful the wooded retreat proved less inspiring than it had 20 years earlier when Jimmy Carter brokered a successful peace accord there between Israel and Egypt Like Trump Clinton identified golf as an entry point into personal relationships with counterparts A round in 2000 with Singapores Prime Minister in Brunei started late and stretched well past midnight American leaders arent alone in using quieter retreats as a setting for talks When Obama visited Saudi Arabia in 2014 thenKing Abdullah received him at his desert getaway oasis Rawdat Khurayim 35 miles outside Riyadh Trump too could soon find himself at another leaders vacation home when he travels to Britain though not necessarily to make him more comfortable Alex Salmond the former Scottish first minister suggested this week that Trumps visit to the United Kingdom may take place at Balmoral the Queens Scotland

31,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/health/male-birth-control-vasalgel-contraceptive-monkey-trial-trnd/index.html,Male contraceptive gel effective in monkeys but will it work in humans,CNNWhen it comes to contraception there are no longlasting easily reversible options for men The only choices are condoms or a vasectomyAnd its been this way for more than a century But a new injectable gel that blocks sperm inside the body preventing them from leaving while allowing seminal fluid to pass through has proved effective in trials using monkeys The researchers behind the product known as Vasalgel hope it could get trials in humans within a few years What was important here was that this worked and was safe in animals similar to humans said Elaine Lissner executive director of the Parsemus Foundation the medical research organization behind Vasalgel that is also leading the trials A new study published Tuesday involved 16 male monkeys receiving injections of Vasalgel who were released into social outdoor housing with females Any adverse effects as well as their ability to impregnate females was compared with a historical sample of monkeys that had received vasectomies It was a simple efficacy study Lissner said meaning the researchers merely set out to see whether the gel was safe and worked to prevent pregnancy The social groups were monitored for at least one breeding season and the team reported in its paper that none of the females in the group conceived during that time One monkey had the gel inserted incorrectly and another developed a sperm granuloma or lump of sperm but the majority tolerated the gel and saw little inflammation Lissner said adding that rates of granuloma and inflammation are usually higher after a vasectomy Lissners team is hoping to conduct clinical trials in humans next year and plans to stage further animal trials this year in preparation But although the gel worked well in monkeys it wont necessarily translate perfectly to humans This is a bigger longer task than we first anticipated Lissner said Stopping sperm in their tracks Administering Vasalgel inside a man or a monkey involves a polymer injected into the spermcarrying tubes between the testicles and penis known as the vas deferens to block sperm as they are released The injection is given under anesthetic and mimics the effect of a vasectomy but without the snip Its a sticky gel that goes into the tubes and basically filters out sperm Lissner said A similar polymer called RISUG is being trialled in India and has proved effective in men The new gel is injected in a location similar to that cut during a vasectomy and allows fluids through while blocking sperm The backedup sperm are then reabsorbed by the body A further benefit is that unlike with a vasectomy the gel is meant to disintegrate when a second solution is injected to break down the barrier and flush it out This would make the process reversible Reversibility was shown in trials on rabbits but it was not tested in the new trial on monkeys Recent trials on baboons also failed to reverse the effect Successful reversibility will be the key to make this worldchanging Lissner said Invasive procedure A further factor likely to impact numbers using this method is that Vasalgel still involves minor surgery to pull out the sperm tubes and inject the gel Whats more when sperm are reabsorbed into the body there is a risk of an immune reaction potentially leaving men less fertile after reversal similar to vasectomy though risks with the gel are lower according to Lissner Fifty percent of men after a vasectomy reversal remain infertile said Dr Ilpo Huhtaniemi emeritus professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the new study However he points out that this doesnt prevent men from having children as sperm can still be collected and used for invitro fertilization The latest evidence on monkeys has many hoping a new form of contraceptive may be on the horizon but experts believe more evidence is first needed on its reversibility In order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible and its reassuring that apparently such studies are ongoing said Allan Pacey professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield who was also not involved in the new research The idea of trying to replace the traditional method of vasectomy by inserting a gel into the tube which carries sperm from the testicles to the penis at ejaculation is not a new one However we havent seen much progress in developing the idea in recent years so this study is a useful step in the right direction A male hormonal birth control injection was shown to prevent pregnancy in a 2016 study but was ended early due to side effects Other approaches have involved strategies to control the production of sperm by targeting the hormone testosterone but this had side effects of depression and weight gain In 2015 Japanese scientists discovered a protein calcineurin found to be crucial in helping sperm swim and break through the membrane of a female egg in order to fertilize it When the genes behind this protein were blocked during studies in mice they became infertile But Vasalgel is further along than the Japanese research and has not shown severe side effects in animals Lissner is confident that her teams gel will overcome the challenges She sees value in providing birth control that does not interfere with hormones Why manipulate the whole body when theres a small tube that all the sperm swim through she asked Huhtaniemi agrees that Vasalgel could be valuable in certain populations but feels that in terms of birth control for the masses a lessinvasive option is needed We need a pill Thats the easiest to administer he said It is feasible We just need to find the right target

42,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/06/arts/bio-art-microbes-and-machines/index.html,Of microbes and machines How art and science fuse in bioart,Sean Redmond is one of the curators of the Morbis Artis Diseases of the Arts exhibition Darrin Sean Verhagen works for RMIT University He has previously received funding from the Australia Council Arts Victoria and City of MelbourneThere is art in science the artistic precision of the scalpel the cool aesthetics of the laboratory and the intimate observations undertaken by scientists to discover new materials and microbes living unseen in the world Bioart an artistic genre that took hold in the 1980s solidifies extends and enriches this organic relationship According to the artist and writer Frances Stracey it represents a crossover of art and the biological sciences with living matter such as genes cells or animals as its new media Bioartists might use and incorporate imaging technologies within the artistic space bringing living and dead matter into the gallery They draw upon biology metaphors to imbue artwork with healing and wounding propensities In BioCouture for example fashion art and biology are weaved together blossoming new materials into existence As author Suzanne Anker has noted Donna Franklin and Gary Cass have invented dresses made from cellulose generated by bacteria from red wine Suzanne Lee composes growing textiles produced by sugar tea and bacteria to fashion jackets and kimonos Lee makes jackets out of cellulose produced by bacteria in baths of green tea and sugar Bioart includes the skins and cells of celluloid and digital video the membranes of sound and the liquids and fluids of body parts and eyeballs To take another example in Christian Bks The Xenotext a chemical alphabet is used to translate poetry into sequences of DNA for subsequent implantation into the genome of a bacterium When translated into a gene and then integrated into the cell the poetry constitutes a set of instructions all of which cause the organism to manufacture a viable benign protein in response Writes Bk I am in effect engineering a lifeform so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem but also an operant machine for writing a poem one that can persist on the planet until the sun itself explodes Scientists and artists work together in what become teeming new spaces of cocreation Together they often set Bioart within current debates and concerns about what constitutes life what counts as a sentient being and who gets to determine what lives are saved exploited or destroyed Bioart draws together the hopes and concerns of scientists and artists as we hurtle into an age where human life and everyday living seems to be undergoing radical and sometimes dangerous transformations As author Sheel Patel suggests in relation to Boks work If a living cell can be cultured to spit out and produce novel poetry could we eventually live in a society where humans are no longer needed to produce new thoughts and works of literature Arts and disease In the interactive artscience exhibition Morbis Artis Diseases of the Arts actual and metaphoric communicative diseases are employed to explore the often toxic relationship between human and nonhuman life The exhibition explores the thin doorway that exists between life and death in a vexing age of species and habitat destruction and the increasingly permeable tissues of contemporary bodies The discourses of science in particular train us to see and to look for disease in every location Sciences microscopic and biotechnological powers allow it to reach into every atom Of course dominant discourse also communes that some spaces things and objects are more diseased than others We are taught to see disease in the homes of outsiders and the nests of insects in the fabric of pariah nation states and the tissues of certain religions and philosophies At the same time new materialism and animal philosophy question the very parameters of what life is where it can be found and they turn the question of disease onto humankind whose activities are seen to infect all that it touches and taints There is a frightening collision then between the possibilities and limitations of human and nonhuman life caught as it were between nightmare and dream Morbis Artis Diseases of the Arts is composed of 11 artistic works with each piece using a different media or art form to explore the chaos of the world it draws upon Each artist imagines disease differently and yet within the terror of their imaginings there is great beauty and much hope In Drew Berrys video projection infectious cells are set free so that the very connective tissue of the exhibition room teems with the droplets of life and death Herpes influenza HIV polio and smallpox bacteria are projected onto the gallery wall as if they have taken flight Magnified and chaotic those entering the space are hit by their scale and size Lienors Torres multimedia and glass work on degenerative vision explores how our view of the world is metered and tainted by digital technologies We see two large glass eyeballs a liquid animation and a glass cabinet full of jars filled with water in varying degrees of opacity with engraved eye images on them Eyes quickly become raindrops as the liquidity of vision is brought to watery life There are tears and scars that reflect across the eyes of this exquisite artpiece In Alison Bennetts touchbased screen work the viewer is presented with a highresolution scan of bruised skin Viewers can use the touchscreen to manipulate the soft and damaged tissue before them and their eyes become organs of touch What does it feel like to touch a bruise and be bruised The gallery is thus both laboratory and studio In all its variant forms and with a scalpel and a paintbrush to hand Bioart fashions the world anew Morbis Artis Diseases of the Arts is currently exhibited at the RMIT Gallery until February 18 2017

45,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/africa/maasai-tanzania-wildlife-warriors/index.html,Lionkiller Maasai turn wildlife warriors to save old enemy,CNNThe Maasai have roamed Tanzania since time immemorial Cattle in tow the East African pastoralists have circled the land looking for fresh grass coexisting with nature for as long as anyone can rememberBut nature is not always kind Fifty percent of the worlds lion population lives in East Africa and lions like to eat livestock Historically the Maasai would use deadly force to protect their herds often heading out in revenge parties to hunt and kill lions There were ritual killings also known as Alamayo Killing a lion a symbol of strength and power was a rite of passage for Maasai initiates into Morani the warrior class Armed with a spear these youths became men in the process returning to the tribe to be treated with newfound respect The Tanzanian government banned ritual killing in the 1970s but certain pockets of activity were silently condoned In Ngorongoro Crater north west of Tarangire National Park and a conservation area since 1959 the practice was judged sustainable due to the high lion concentration and low human presence In the 1960s the tribe claimed no more than 10 animals per year but as with so much of the world in the 20th century the Maasais population grew in Ngorongoro Forty lions if not more are now under threat annually in the conservation area and all over Tanzania lion numbers are declining Conservationists know the problem needs to be addressed and in a remarkable turnaround theyve enlisted the very best gamekeepers to patrol the Maasai Steppe the Maasai themselves At around 5am the Maasai Wildlife Warriors rise to birdsong natures alarm clock A bowl of porridge and cup of chai to start the day Slipping on a pair of sandals their soles recycled from old car tires the Warriors head out of their kraal a small sheltered community to begin tracking These Maasai have traded in their hunting ways for a life of conservation Part of an initiative run by the Tanzania People and Wildlife Fund an organization specializing in humananimal conflict the Warriors are spread across communities in Tarangire and the surrounding rangeland using their skills their lifeblood to protect what was once their adversary Beyond the boma a low wall surrounding the kraal tracks line the dirt They betray the lions hyenas and wild dogs who visit in the night drawn to livestock and in the dry season the communitys water supply On an uneventful day Warriors might take a car owned by the Fund and conduct an animal headcount circling the Steppe in the early morning But sometimes tracks start inside the boma suggesting a big cat When big cat footprints are involved they usually lead to a kill The next step is crucial People are becoming more and more angry towards wildlife says Wildlife Warrior Lucas Lengoje In the past a carcass resulted in retribution The head of cattle per person has decreased among the Maasai in recent years meaning the pain of every loss is felt all the more The community finds it very difficult to comprehend the importance of the wildlife Lengoje adds It takes time to calm them down and for them to believe you as they care more about their livestock than wildlife Some of the reprisals have become extreme Aside from spearings Maasai have begun poisoning carcasses between a lions initial gorge and second feed This not only kills the lion but anything that feeds on the lions subsequent carcass Wildlife Warriors intercede dissipate the situation and ultimately provide solutions for their communities and those around them One of their primary concerns is to document the attack and location using GPS to map the incident on the Funds database Theyll also warn neighboring herders of the dangers nearby and sometimes provide contact details so Maasai can claim compensation from the government Then begins the longterm approach to preventing cattle loss Living Walls African myrrh trees joined by chain link fences are being used by the Fund and built in collaboration with the Maasai and have been rolled out across communities The difference between the boma and the Living Wall is that the living wall uses chain link explains Elvis Kisimir from the Fund Bomas contain dried twigs from the thorny acacia bush but chain link is infinitely more effective especially when fortified with living fastgrowing thorny trees which only become more impassable with age In the wet season these walls reach over 12 feet high We currently have more than 700 bomas and the Living Wall is a program that has safeguarded 99 of our livestock at night says Kisimir This immediate success is being supplemented with education programs fronted by Maasai Wildlife Warriors aimed at neutralizing any antagonism between man and his fellow predators If we decided to do this on our own we wouldnt achieve much admits Kisimir Community is everything Laly Lichtenfeld executive director of the Fund describes this as the next step and a way to help create a selfregulating environment in which both Maasai and lions can prosper The Maasai people are absolutely critically integral to the conservation process in northern Tanzania she adds This is their land and their livelihoods are so dependent on wise environmental stewardship Healthy grasslands mean healthy livestock And the livestock the cattle are core of their being who they are Its their pride its their identity its their economic wellbeing And so if they can manage to really keep these ecosystems intact and healthy then everything in the system benefits

spiritual leader of an entire people youve lived your entire adult life in exile your movements are restricted by everwatchful bodyguards and you must watch every word for fear of setting off an international incident you would think your face would reflect the weight of the worldBut when you are the Dalai Lama the deepest lines on your 81yearold skin are laugh lines His Holiness knows how to find joy in nearly everything and everyone largely because of his sense of humor It is something he uses regularly to quickly win over crowds and something he thinks everyone should embrace in order to have a better life When he presided over the EmoryTibet Symposium in December at an imposing temple owned by the Tibetan community in exile in Mundgod India he showed his teasing nature right away Gathered were thousands of saffronrobed nuns and monks worldrenowned scientists Tibetans and many interested followers eager learn how to bridge science and Buddhism for mutual enrichment The crowd looked as serious as the topic As they waited in the temple they murmured quietly and shifted in their seats Finally the low moan of a guttural chant began and everyone quieted and sat up a little straighter When His Holiness finally emerged from a side door the sound of scraping plastic chairs echoed throughout the hall as the crowd stood and applauded Some prostrated themselves on the ground His Holiness walked in slowly surrounded by monks in traditional robes and bodyguards in Western dress Two monks gently guided him down a small set of steps At the bottom the Dalai Lama smiled with great joy laughing and waving at the friends gathered in his honor When you smile I notice everyone around you smiles I notice it is very contagious as well said Dr Sanjay Gupta CNNs Chief Medical correspondent in an interview with His Holiness after the event Basically we are social animal the Dalai Lama replied We need friend In order to develop genuine friendship trust is very important For trust if you show them genuine sort of respect genuine love then trust come so here I think the expression of genuine warm feeling smile I think part of that thats genuine smile But it is clear that joking around is also key to winning over a crowd At the event the Dalai Lama finally sat in his floral chair against what looked like a pillow one of the monks must have grabbed from his bed hoping to make him more comfortable The crowd quieted leaning forward to hear what His Holiness had to say But instead of a prayer or a gentle word of wisdom he decided it was the perfect time to wipe his brow He took his time and then rather than putting the white washcloth on the table next to him he immediately put it on his head where it rested like an absurd floppy hat Giggling he wore it through first part of the meeting for about an hour Then he reached with some ceremony for a glass jar of candy on the low table in front of him This is not decoration he joked holding it up He pointed to himself eat and promptly unwrapped the gold foil to pop a hard candy into his mouth His impish behavior laughing and joking did the trick The solemn and respectful crowd began laughing with him warming up immediately Everyone seemed ready to listen to a discussion of heavy topics such as What are the fundamental constituents of the universe and how did it originate and How is knowledge established and what constitutes valid reasoning When Gupta later asked His Holiness about why he decided to wear the washcloth so comically the Dalai Lama admitted it was in part because he is practical and gets hot But he also hinted that there was something deeper Its important for leaders particularly spiritual leaders to act like a human being and to be playful Often everyone too much formal he said That is selftorture And though he knows he must respect those leaders despite no word no movement from them he has sometimes developed a strange thinking and often hopes something unexpected will happen to make that leader act more like a human being I had this experience in 1954 when I was in Peking His Holiness said Some Indian ambassador he call on me come to my room then as usual some Chinese foreign ministries officials come Everyone too much formal like that he said then mimed being stiff Then somehow they brought some fruit somehow dumped over and then everyone acted like a human being he said laughing and miming people scrambling around as he saw them do around on the floor His Holiness suggests everyone let themselves be playful and find the funny in life In his book My Spiritual Journey he calls himself a professional laugher and writes that he comes from a cheerful family that is always amusing ourselves teasing each other joking Its our habit A quick laugh and an ability to see humor in daily situations and to be playful have been shown to help adults lower stress levels both for themselves and for those around them studies show By being playful and using humor people also become more observant and more empathetic They are often bored less they learn more they have more friends and studies show that people who are willing to let out their playful side tend to have a better sense of allaround wellbeing His Holiness believes that no matter how difficult your life may be this approach will bring you something much deeper Thinking only of the negative aspect doesnt help to find solutions and it destroys peace of mind he writes I love smiles and my wish is to see more smiles real smiles If we want those smiles we must create the reasons that make them appear

48,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/opinions/trump-claim-on-under-covering-terrorism-is-baloney-bergen/index.html,Trumps terrorism claim is baloney,Peter Bergen is CNNs national security analyst a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University He is the author of United States of Jihad Investigating Americas Homegrown TerroristsNow comes President Donald Trumps claim Monday at the key US military base overseeing the war on ISIS US Central Command in Tampa Florida that the media arent reporting terrorism for reasons the President didnt elaborate upon Trump told the CENTCOM audience Youve seen what happened in Paris and Nice All over Europe its happening Its gotten to a point where its not even being reported And in many cases the very very dishonest press doesnt want to report it They have their reasons and you understand that To prove that the media arent covering terrorism adequately the Trump White House which is fighting in court to reinstate a refugee ban citing the terrorist threat on Monday night released a list of 78 major terrorist attacks since September 2014 claiming Most have not received the media attention they deserved This is one of the biggest baloney sandwiches this White House has foisted on the public since well the Bowling Green massacre but its a much bigger and harderto swallow helping of baloney because it is the President who is forcing it down our throats rather than one of his aides Taking the White House timeline of terrorist attacks I ran it through the Nexis database which is an authoritative resource for tracking media hits of all types including in newspapers magazines wire service reports TV news shows and the like The results show that terrorist attacks over the past couple of years are in fact some of the most wellreported stories of our times The total number of media hits for the 78 terrorist attacks that the White House released Monday is 80878 or about an average of slightly more than 1000 mentions per incident And those numbers clearly understate how much coverage the media have given these incidents because a Nexis search only will display a maximum of 3000 mentions for any given search There are 16 terrorist attacks on the White House list of purportedly undercovered attacks that each elicited more than 3000 media mentions The following are a representative sample In Ottawa in October 2014 Michael ZehafBibeau killed a Canadian soldier Two months later in Sydney Man Haron Monis killed two Australians In March 2015 21 tourists were killed at the Bardo Museum in Tunis Tunisia Two months later in Garland Texas two ISISinspired militants attacked a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest Luckily no one was killed except the terrorists In Tunisia also in 2015 38 were killed at a beach popular with Westerners In October 2015 224 were killed in Sinai Egypt when ISIS brought down a Russian passenger jet with a bomb The terror attacks in Paris and Nice France that Trump cited in his CENTCOM speech also received more than 3000 media mentions The terrorist attacks that didnt get as much coverage were surprise the ones where there were no deaths or that took place in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh where there is little independent media reporting In three cases there were no articles listed in the publications included in the Nexis database and in each of those cases there were no casualties The media including CNN have exhaustively covered terrorism around the globe since the 911 attacks made the issue a central national security concern Indeed the walltowall media coverage of the ISIS attacks in Paris in November 2015 in which 129 were killed and the ISISinspired attack in San Bernardino California a month later in which 14 were killed was instrumental in boosting Trump in the polls according to the polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight Many Americans felt threatened by the ISISdirected and ISISinspired attacks As the presidential campaign was in full swing at the beginning of 2016 just over half of Americans said they were very or somewhat worried that they or a member of their family would be victims of a terrorist attack This was the largest number to feel that way since just after the 911 attacks And how did so many Americans learn about the terrorist attacks they were so scared of Heres a clue It wasnt through telepathy Below is the official White House timeline of terrorist attacks since September 2014 with my annotations in bold about the media coverage they each received There are a number

49,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/opinions/fight-for-democracy-opinion-ghitis/index.html,Trump vs America The fight for democracy,Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review and a former CNN producer and correspondent The views expressed in this commentary are her ownTrump was defending the Russian President after Foxs Bill OReilly called Putin a killer His response You think our country is so innocent reveals Trumps dismissive attitude toward the most fundamental democratic norms that America has aspired to embody Clearly the United States has made many grave mistakes throughout history but the countrys guiding principles have remained unchanged the fierce defense of individual liberties and an unshakeable commitment to democratic ideals In Russia by contrast Putin has decimated the opposition imprisoned critics and taken control of all branches of government The free press is a faint shadow of its former self and Putins critics including journalists continue to turn up dead under suspicious circumstances One of Putins most vocal critics Vladimir KaraMurza remains in a Moscow hospital in grave condition after suffering a full organ failure that as his lawyer told CNN doctors agree is the result of a toxic substance Despite Trumps comments and recent executive actions Trump should expect pushback from a country committed to liberal democratic principles This division between the President and the American people makes the United States the latest battleground in a worldwide clash of ideologies When the wave of populist authoritarianism started few would have expected the United States the principal beacon of modern democracy for over 200 years to fall under the spell of nativist politics But fall it did The many Americans who remain skeptical of Trump and now find themselves protesting on a weekly basis can take comfort in knowing they are not alone On Sunday while the American public was rapt in the Super Bowl an astonishing sight came into focus in Romania Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest a government push to decriminalize corruption The remarkable part was that protesters had already won Demonstrations had begun six days earlier after the government tried to quietly pass a decree that would have cleared the records and freed from prison people convicted of corruption for amounts less than 47000 The government agreed to rescind the order But the demonstrations only grew with protesters saying they came out to protect their democracy Romanians knew they had to fight for democracy because of their recent communist past and the onslaught in neighboring countries against liberal democracy which requires separation of powers a free judiciary free and fair elections and yes freedom to protest Sadly now in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the surge of refugee arrivals demagogic politicians have leveraged popular discontent lashing out against foreigners vowing to put their countrys true residents first and gradually dismantling the foundations of liberal democracy Romanians seem to have won round one But the forces defending democracy elsewhere including in neighboring Hungary have been losing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly declared hes building an illiberal state and is making strides in his quest to imitate regimes run by the likes of Putin Democratic freedoms have suffered sharp reverses in recent years Turkey is slipping into dictatorship Venezuela remains mired in autocracy as do countries in every continent But whats ahead for the United States Some veterans of the battle are pessimistic When millions of mostly women took to the streets the day after Trumps inauguration Julia Ioffe whose family fled Russia threw cold water on their jubilant movement tweeting The happy feisty crowds the clever signs it all feels like the protests in Moscow in 2011 That went nowhere Its true that protests have not achieved much against other authoritarian regimes In Venezuela the Chavista regime came to power in 1999 and despite every effort from a determined opposition it remains in power In Turkey mass demonstrations and even what seemed like electoral victories have failed to stop Recep Tayyip Erdogans march to de facto dictator In Russia Putin is all but unchallenged with a quiescent legislature and nearcomplete control of the news Russians consume But the story is likely to have a different outcome in the United States Yascha Mounk a Harvard expert in rightwing populism observed that Trump is turning out to be more authoritarian than I feared though the opposition is also proving more courageous than I expected America has deeper democratic roots than any of the countries whose liberal democracies has been toppled The national religion is freedom from tyranny The day after Trump took office Americans put on what may have been the largest national demonstration in the countrys history A week later when Trump issued his travel ban for seven Muslimmajority countries spontaneous demonstrations materialized at major airports across the country Lawyers filed legal briefs on the spot While the Republicancontrolled Congress has proven mostly silent in countering Trumps attacks on the independent media and the judiciary the press appears determined to do its job and judges seem unintimidated by White House bullying Even members of the executive branch are speaking out Many Americans support Trump but there are signs that his sharp break with democratic traditions his attacks on judges his fulminations against the media and against critics of all stripes from comedians to restaurant reviewers are producing a backlash History is being written by two opposing forces those fighting for and those fighting against liberal democracy President Trumps likening of America to Putins Russia puts him on the illiberal side But the American people have spent hundreds of years building a strong democratic system and they are prepared to fight to defend it

53,2016/12/21,http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/americas/costa-rica-migration/index.html,The other migrant crisis Thousands risk journey through Latin America,Paso Canoas Costa Rica CNNYolanda ticks off the countries she and her husband have passed through in the last three months Brazil Peru Ecuador Colombia Panama and now Costa Rica But she is no touristA lot of roads lots of bus rides and a lot of walking too she tells CNN agreeing to be interviewed but asking that we only use her first name and not show her face For a 7month pregnant woman that is a long long time Yolanda says she is originally from Congo She and her husband are among tens of thousands of migrants many from Africa and Haiti crisscrossing South and Central America trying to reach the United States Now theyre stuck in the border town of Paso Canoas Costa Rica waiting for the travel documents that will let them enter the country and continue their journey northward I hope to leave soon for my turn to come fast so I can see a doctor she says I dont want my baby to be born on the road Read Deadly crossing into Europe Long an obligatory stop on an important trade and tourist route Paso Canoas has seen an unprecedented influx of migrants trekking north in recent months The huge surge in undocumented arrivals is a logistical and humanitarian nightmare for the government of Costa Rica At this moment Costa Rica is absolutely overwhelmed with our immigration situation and were doing our best to protect the human rights of the people who are coming said Mauricio Herrera Ulloa the Costa Rican Communications Minister and point person for the migration crisis No one was prepared or was thinking about the possibility that we would receive 10000 people from Haiti or Africa Perilous journeys Since April when Costa Rica first started issuing transit visas for undocumented migrants more than 18000 people have crossed the border into the country There are no comparative figures because the demand simply wasnt there in previous years so the visas didnt exist officials say It is a situation that is being replicated in border towns throughout the Americas Experts say migrants are risking their lives in perilous journeys that expose them to crime and hunger and leave them vulnerable to human trafficking They offer migrants something that they really need and in the case of these people what they really need is to get one more border north says Cy Winter director of border management for the International Organization for Migration IOM More on human trafficking That means they often pay socalled coyotes for illegal border crossings breaking their ties to the state and public administration system They often fall prey to false job offers just over the border But then on the other side whats arranged there is completely different says Winter So they end up in a place where they have to work and theyve got no way to get away from it Congo isnt a country its a password The IOM and other experts believe the majority of migrants are Haitians many of them pretending to be Congolese in order to avoid deportation since it would be too costly for most Latin American countries to fly them to Africa And in both Haiti and Congo French is spoken The people Ive spoken to claiming to be from Congo barely know the capital and dont know the dialects that are spoken in the Congo and dont know the football jersey said Winter According to the US Secretary of Homeland Security some 40000 Haitian migrants are working their way north already overwhelming many border crossings into the United States Many of them entered Brazil as legal refugees after the 2010 earthquake But the economic crisis in Brazil has made it increasingly difficult for migrants to get jobs sparking an exodus Weve seen accumulations of up to 5000 people on the border in various countries in South America so it is a concerning uptick in arrivals said Winter One migrant I met on the PanamanianCosta Rican border told me that every single one of the dozens of Congolese migrants milling about the migration office was actually from Haiti Here Congo isnt a country its a password he said explaining that he and others destroy their passports so that they can reinvent themselves The bottlenecks at borders have raised serious concerns The IOM has begun offering workshops at schools like Colegio Progreso in Panama just across the border from Paso Canoas teaching students about the connection between migration and human trafficking In the past the school was used as a shelter for hundreds of Cubans trying to make their way to the United States The regional school director says she heard stories of women turning to prostitution in desperation In relation to the people being trafficked weve heard horror stories said Flor Bonilla In San Jose the capital of Costa Rica Marilia Morales is just as worried She founded the nonprofit Rahab Foundation 20 years ago to rescue rehabilitate and support survivors of sexual exploitation Now shes launching a project on Costa Ricas northern border with Nicaragua We have an avalanche of people coming we have Africans Haitians we have people coming from a lot of places Morales told CNN We are in the process of training our personnel and we are going to be working with this community directly because they have to be aware that they could be victims of human trafficking either for slave labor sexual slavery and other ends she said Nicaragua has closed its borders to undocumented migrants forcing thousands on the border into deplorable makeshift shelters and tent villages On Costa Ricas southern border officials are trying to process migrants as quickly as possible Theyre admitting 100200 a day but there is a long waiting list In Yolandas case her hopes for a quick trip through Costa Rica were quickly dashed Upon arrival she was told she would have to wait six weeks just for an appointment with immigration officials Without the laissezpasser she and her husband cant access the shelters set up by authorities in conjunction with the Red Cross warehouses and schools where migrants get free meals and a mattress to sleep on For the time being they are sleeping in a makeshift hostel just a short walk from the border They pay 5 a day and squeeze in with some 50 other people Yolanda says she left Congo for Brazil where she worked in a restaurant for a year She says both she and her husband lost their jobs in the recession just as they discovered she was pregnant Now their dream is for their daughter to be born in the United States But the odds are not in their favor The money they borrowed from family back home is running out and she says they cant ask for more While Yolanda says she is from Congo when I first met her she couldnt at first remember or pronounce what she said was her hometown Brazzaville the capital of Congo When the time came to say goodbye to Yolanda and her husband I couldnt help but wonder where they came from and where this journey will ultimately take them Unfortunately for Haitians trying to make their way into the United States officials recently eliminated the generous benefits and easy entry that were established after the 2010 earthquake Which means that even if they make it to the US border after months of travel and hardship neither Haitian nor Congolese migrants are likely to get in
54,2016/8/23,http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/world/canada-indigenous-sex-trafficking/index.html,Canadas stolen daughters Sex traffickers target indigenous Canadians,Winnipeg Canada CNNAs Lauren Chopek painfully details her story she does so with the reticence of a survivor as if somehow remaining silent would have been betterI used to blame myself for everything But like I I would say I let them do that to me I am dirty Its my fault says Chopek through tears But Chopek is finally speaking out determined to shake the guilt and shame that she knows should stalk her perpetrators instead of her Now I see that I was just a child says Chopek now sitting serenely in a safe house a healing lodge in rural Manitoba that cradled her in the love and protection she so needed when she escaped her life on the streets Now 19 Lauren was just 14 when she was sexually exploited and trafficked for sex in her hometown of Winnipeg But as an indigenous girl in Canada her story is hardly rare More from the CNN Freedom Project Canadas indigenous population is very small just 4 of the population yet more than 50 of all sex trafficking victims in Canada are indigenous The reasons are complicated and varied but are ultimately rooted in a legacy of poverty racism and abuse I was actually making these bad choices for a reason explains Chopek You know when you experience sexual abuse its really confusing You never know if its your fault or is it theirs Targets of violence and abuse Diane Redsky runs Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre which advocates for indigenous women and children specifically sex trafficking victims Her organization runs the rural healing lodge where Chopek stayed as well as safe houses rehabilitation and prevention programs throughout Manitoba Read Trafficked women tattooed by their pimps Redsky says the history of racism against indigenous Canadians feeds into the cycle of violence and exploitation against them Its really difficult to be able to fight those stereotypes as indigenous women when a whole society is targeting indigenous women and girls particularly for violence and abuse and that spills over into sex trafficking says Redsky Tanay Littles story shows how insidious the abuse can be Little was just 11 when she was sexually exploited on the streets surrounding her familys home in Winnipeg An older girl someone who pretended to be her friend she says was actually preying on Little first luring her with drugs and then trafficking her for sex I remember one time that she put me in a room and then two guys one not together but one would come in and then I would have sex with him and then the other the other guy would come in And then Id get high after that says Little She is blunt about what would happen if she refused to have sex with anybody If youre not beat up then you would get raped by a few of them at once explains Little There is a debt bondage thats between 1000 and 2000 a day that these girls must bring must hand in to their trafficker or else says Redsky These startling anecdotes have been heard in family homes police stations and safe houses for years in Manitoba The province is now taking the lead on an innovative approach to prevention and rehabilitation Focus on the victims Redsky and others in Manitoba are now leading transformative programs to help identify the threats and risks so prevalent in indigenous communities It is a new approach to help fight sex trafficking one that focuses on the needs of the victims Jennifer Richardson runs Tracias Trust Manitobas strategy to combat sexual exploitation and sex trafficking of children Crucially Manitobas government has committed more than 10 million Canadian a year to fund it a huge sum for a population of only about a million people Within a 10year span Manitoba has really grown this massive strategy that is just recognized throughout Canada as being kind of the frontier leaders in this area says Richardson Read I was raped 43200 times The program is different and revolutionary for Manitoba because it uses not only targeted funds but also words deeds and training to fight human trafficking in a whole new way Outreach on neighborhood streets is one strategy that is executed with the help of law enforcement officers Almost daily Winnipeg Police dispatch an elite unit on the streets to try and counter sexual exploitation and human trafficking The approach is a departure for Winnipeg Police who now say their efforts are firmly focused on helping victims Outreach is conducted in a way to help victims and then bring their perpetrators to justice Law enforcement officials acknowledge a history of bias and racism that in the past prevented police from truly understanding how and why indigenous girls are vulnerable and at risk There is bias in the police service We recognize it that theres implicit bias We certainly have taken steps to try to address that in a myriad of ways says Danny Smyth Winnipegs deputy police chief We have a team thats dedicated just to outreach Just to being out there and trying to get to know whos out on the street and trying to establish a relationship with them adds Smyth The legacy of years of abuse and racism though are making it difficult for Canadas indigenous community to heal and move on Canada will soon launch an inquiry that will focus on why hundreds of indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been murdered over the years Canadian and independent studies have revealed that indigenous women and girls are five times more likely to die in violent circumstances than nonindigenous women and girls Were still in a society that targets indigenous women and girls In fact the national task force concluded that theres a market for indigenous girls says Redsky adding what that leads to is a society who views indigenous women as less than and in fact of no human value
55,2016/4/22,http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/21/us/project-vic-child-abuse/index.html,How child predator was caught by tiny clue in photo he posted online,CNNIn a bathroom the predator has placed a child on the counter to photograph his evil actsIn the background of the photo which was posted online are products including prescription medication But zooming in on that pill bottle makes the details unreadable In a small dark lab Jim Cole special agent and supervisor of Victim Identification at the Homeland Security Investigations Cyber Crimes Center gets to work using the latest technology available Using technology to identify abusers Utilizing some technology that hadnt even been released to the public yet we were able to take a look at the bottle and reverse out some of the motion blur Cole said They can now see the offenders first name Stephen the first two letters of the last name and the first three digits on the prescription order With that he applies to the pharmacy for the customer details of every person who fits that criteria It narrows the list down to a man named Stephen Keating But thats not all The offenders fingers are also in the picture and incredibly this crack team manages to pull the fingerprints from the image That was the first time we were able to do that Cole said The evidence was strong enough to put Stephen Keating behind bars for 110 years Investigators rescued his 14 victims No victim left behind Cole cofounded Project VIC their aim is that no victim is be left behind We strive to find these children as quick as possible Cole said The longer it takes us the longer that child is in harms way Read Raid reunites trafficked sisters Its not an easy task when Cole says they are seeing 500000 images a week thats over 25 million a year The Keating case ran for about three weeks and in the past it could have taken months or worse the image may never have been uncovered at all Using technology known as Photo DNA their computers can wade through the hundreds of thousands of photos fast categorizing the ones theyve already seen to allow his team to focus on the new victims What used to take us nine months now takes us a month said Cole It helps us review video on a scale of about 100 times faster than previously he added Its been a complete gamechanger for law enforcement and we get that feedback from the field all the time Easing psychological burden The efficiency not only saves time it helps ease the psychological burden on investigators We definitely see a mental health benefit because the nature of our offenders is they are trading material weve seen hundreds of thousands of times in addition to the new material Cole said Read Vietnamese girls smuggled in to China sold as brides The technology helped investigators find a seemingly harmless photo of a known offender with her victim on vacation The image showed the pair holding fish at a campsite The fish were isolated from the image and sent to Cornell University which provided investigators with a geographical area where those fish can be caught The campsite image with the child and perpetrator removed was sent to every single campsite advertiser in that location Upon tracking down the actual campsite they found the same photo posted in the reception room Within four hours we had her identified Cole said The child was rescued and the woman is now serving a 25year sentence On another image of an offender with a young girl the Project VIC team noticed a company logo on the mans sweatshirt but they couldnt decipher what was written Some cutting edge technology helped make the logo almost completely readable An online search for names that might match the letters led investigators to a plumbing business The offender a former employee was tracked down and four victims were rescued Global problem The number of images like these being shared online is on the rise Last year the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC received 44 million reports to its CyberTipline Thats a nearly 800 increase in reporting since 2013 Tipoffs come from the public and also companies like Facebook Google and Twitter who are mandated by US regulations to report any such images According to Lindsay Olson director of the Exploited Child Division at NCMEC 94 of the cases last year were outside the United States The CyberTipline receives reports of child porn online enticement of children for sexual acts online sex trafficking child molestation any type of child exploitation can be reported to the cyber tip line said Olson We make reports available to law enforcement in about 100 countries and we also work with Europol and Interpol Swedish based company Griffeye was one of the founding partners of Project VIC Director Johann Hofmann says it donates its software to be used in child exploitation cases As more and more crime is becoming more and more digital as data is being distributed online he said You see a new type of police officer that is behind a computer screen and with the right tools they can crack these cases The Internet has no borders so law enforcement agencies need to overcome traditional geographic boundaries to work together Project VIC is now being used by Interpol Europol and agencies in 35 countries including the United Kingdom and Canada and its about to be rolled out in Australia In the United States the results speak for themselves Weve been absolutely floored by the success weve seen with Project VIC said Cole Going back a few years we were seeing victims in the low hundreds and in this past year weve rescued over 1000 victims just in HSI Homeland Security Investigations a division of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE alone and weve seen similar results in other agencies as well
56,2016/4/19,http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/17/asia/vietnamese-girls-child-brides-china/index.html,Vietnamese girls smuggled into China and sold as child brides,The names of the trafficked girls in this story have been changed to protect their identitiesLan remembers the night that changed her whole life While preparing for university along the border in northern Vietnam a friend she met online asked her to a group dinner When she was tired and wanted to go home the people asked her to stay and talk and have a drink Next thing she knew she had been smuggled across the border to China At that time I wanted to leave says Lan There were other girls there in the car but there was people to guard us The villages along the VietnameseChinese border are a hunting ground for human traffickers Girls as young as 13 say they are tricked or drugged then spirited across the porous border by boat motorbike or car Young Vietnamese women are valuable commodities in China where the onechild policy and longstanding preference for sons has heavily skewed the gender ratio To put it simply Chinese men are hungry for brides It costs a very huge amount of money for normal Chinese man to get married to a Chinese woman explained Ha Thi Van Khanh national project coordinator for the UNs antitrafficking organization in Vietnam Traditionally Chinese men wishing to marry local women are expected to pay for an elaborate banquet and to have purchased a new home to live in after the wedding This is why they try to import women from neighboring countries including Vietnam Diep Vuong started the Pacific Links Foundation to combat trafficking in Vietnam She says that Vietnamese brides can sell for upwards of 3000 to the end buyer and that they are often considered desirable because of cultural similarities to the Chinese Nguyen was just 16 when a friends boyfriend drugged her and smuggled her into China She tried to resist a forced marriage For three months she refused even though her traffickers beat her withheld food and threatened to kill her she says Finally she relented She says her husband was kind to her but she never stopped missing her family in Vietnam My desire to go home was indescribable Nguyen said I agreed to marry the man but I could not stay with a stranger without any feelings for him When her motherinlaw realized Lan was never going to warm to the marriage the family returned her to the traffickers They got their money back Nguyen says after which she was forced into a second marriage A refuge for escaped women The Pacific Links Foundation runs a shelter for trafficking victims in the city of Lao Cai northern Vietnam The young women stay for an average of two to three years They go to school or get vocational training They do art therapy They learn to cook and sew and keep a big garden Surrounded by other woman with similar experiences the shelter helps them get back on their feet and then to find jobs to support themselves Once that whole investment process can happen with these young women then it is much easier for them to have their own lives says Diep Her organization also does community outreach to try and stop more girls from falling into the hands of traffickers About once a month a group of trafficking victims visits the market at Bac Ha a regional hub for buying food fabric and livestock On this day on a stage overlooking hundreds of shoppers they talk about their experiences take questions and play games with the crowd When they ask people to share personal experiences concerning trafficking more than 20 people come forward I think awareness is the only tool Diep says Ha from the UN agrees that the top priority is to spread awareness especially in the poor rural regions along the border She also believes reducing poverty will help stop women going to China seeking work another common way traffickers lure victims Saved at the border During CNNs trip to the border the government called and told us the police had just rescued five girls as they were about to cross the border with a trafficker We met the girls who are just 14 years old They said they were promised 600 to go to work in China by a neighbor from the same village They didnt tell their parents they were going The neighbor is now under arrest The Vietnamese police are sometimes able to rescue women even after they have crossed into China by enlisting the help of Chinese authorities Nguyen Tuong Long the head of the governments social vice prevention department in Lao Cai says last year they rescued and returned 109 Vietnamese trafficking victims Because of cooperation between the Vietnamese and the Chinese police we have found and caught trafficking rings Nguyen says Weve found women far inside China at brothels where theyre forced to become sex workers Trafficked women who arent rescued in raids have to find ways to get out on their own Some of them say they were able to contact their families from China but they couldnt get help from police because they didnt know exactly where they were Lan and Nguyen ended up in the same town in China After two years together they managed to slip out of their homes and take a taxi to a local police station The whole time they were afraid their husbands families would find them The Chinese police investigated and eventually returned them to Vietnam The women were free of their forced marriages but they paid a high price Both left their babies in China Lan says if she saw her daughter again she would apologize for leaving her behind I hope shell have a better life there she says Both Lan and Nguyen say in school their teachers had talked to them about trafficking At the time neither believed it could happen to them

60,2017/2/7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-us/should-scientists-engage_b_14636016.html,Should scientists engage in activism,By Ivan Oransky New York University and Adam Marcus Johns Hopkins University Have you heard that scientists are planning a march on Washington The move is not being billed as a protest but rather as a celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community although it comes as a direct response to recent policy changes and statements by the Trump administration Not everyone thinks the nonprotest protest is a good thing Its a terrible idea wrote Robert Young a geologist at Western Carolina University in The New York Times The march Young said will just reinforce a belief among some conservatives that scientists are an interest group and polarize the issue making researchers jobs more difficult Others find that argument less than convincing pointing out that science and politics have always been intertwined As the founders of the blog Retraction Watch and the Center for Scientific Integrity we often see researchers reluctant to push for or embrace change whether its to the conventional way of dealing with misconduct in journals which for years was basically to not do so or addressing problems of reproducibility of their experiments To the timorous airing dirty laundry and letting the public in on the reality of science could endanger public trust and funding So this isnt the first time scientists and engineers have voiced similar concerns Take the example of Marc Edwards and his colleagues at Virginia Tech To many people watching the Flint water crisis they were heroes After being asked to visit by concerned residents they found and announced that people in the beleaguered city were being exposed to excessive amounts of lead through their tap water They also launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for water filters for city residents and created a website to push their findings about the hazards of the citys water supply and shame governments at all levels to act If not for their tireless efforts thousands of children may have been exposed to dangerous amounts of lead for far longer than they already were Even the Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged that it waited too long to sound the alarm But thats not exactly how the editor of a leading engineering journal sees things In October a remarkable editorial appeared in the journal Environmental Science Technology The essay by University of California Berkeley engineering professor and Water Center Director David Sedlak ESTs editorinchief expressed concern that some of his colleagues in the field had crossed the imaginary line between scientist and advocate Speaking out against a corrupt or incompetent system may be the product of a culture where idealism personal responsibility and Hollywoods dramatic sensibilities conspire to create a narrative about the noble individual fighting injustice Sedlak wrote By becoming allies of a particular cause no matter how just we jeopardize the social contract that underpins the tradition of financial support for basic research In other words dont cross Congress which many scientists already view as hostile to their profession and risk retaliation in the form of budget cuts Thats no small pie either Through its oversight of the National Institutes of Health the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Department of Energy and other agencies and programs Congress holds the strings to a research purse worth nearly US70 billion a year Lets take a moment to absorb all that Some unnamed but easily identified scientists lulled by the media have cast themselves as superheroes in a struggle against villains born of their own conceit Their arrogance and vanity threaten to awaken the master who will punish us all for the sins of a few We rarely get the opportunity to watch a chilling effect in action but you can almost see the breath of researchers caught up in a debate over the proper role of scientists in the crisis Its not just engineers who fear speaking out We have too often been reluctant to voice our protest for fear of incurring the National Institute of Mental Healths displeasure and losing whatever opportunities we still have for funding wrote neuroscientist John Markowitz in The New York Times last fall In a refreshing piece Markowitz was arguing that theres such a thing as too much neuroscience As cofounders of Retraction Watch a blog that focuses on some of sciences nasty episodes we are occasionally admonished that pointing out cases of fraud even when we also praise good behavior will give antiscience forces ammunition In some ways we should be glad scientists are acknowledging these concerns instead of pretending theyre never swayed by the almighty dollar But anyone who clings to the notion that science exists in a pure vacuum untainted by politics economics or social justice needs also to understand that science is a human endeavor and scientists have the same eyes and ears for injustice and outrage as the rest of us Although the conduct of science demands honesty and rigor nowhere is it written that researchers must remain silent when governments or other powerful players either misuse science or suppress findings in the service of harmful policies And before Edwards and his efforts on behalf of the Flint community some scientists have spoken out Claire Patterson a physical chemist put himself on a decadeslong collision course with industry when he took on lead poisoning John Snow earned the ire of Londoners when he removed the pump handle on a cholerainfested well and wasnt vindicated until after his death It took Peter Buxtun several years to stop the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment he eventually had to leak documents to reporter Jean Heller in 1972 Edwards and his colleagues we would argue are part of a long tradition of bridging the worlds of science and policy They have been instrumental in bringing not only attention but change to the beleaguered city of Flint And money Thanks in part to their pressure the Senate in September voted overwhelmingly to approve 100 million in aid for Flint and hundreds of millions more in loans from the Environmental Protection Agency for upgrading municipal water infrastructures and studying exposure to lead In a stinging rebuke to Sedlak Edwards and three coauthors Amy Pruden Siddhartha Roy and William Rhoads blasted the critical editorial as a devastating selfindictment of cowardice and perverse incentives in modern academia Indeed scientists who accept funding with the tacit agreement that they keep their mouths shut about the government are far more threatening to an independent academy than those who speak their minds Since Nov 8 it has been painfully clear that science will be playing defense for a while The United States has never seen a regime so hostile to science and the value of the scientific method President Donald Trump has declared climate change a hoax cooked up by the Chinese He has flirted seriously with debunked antivaccination views and declared that polls read data that are negative about his ambitions are fake news Science and politics are not always compatible And science need not always triumph over policy After all research shows that steroids improve athletic performance but we have a compelling political interest to ban them The same can be said of eugenics Research must always be ethical and ethics is a conversation that includes scientists and policymakers Still while the two domains are separate the divide is and should be bridgeable As Edwards and his colleagues write The personal and professional peril is great the critics are numerous and vocal but staying silent is to be complicit in perpetrating injustice And no matter what may come of the rest of our lives or careers we are certain of one thing Flint was a community worth going out on a limb for and by upholding a just cause we enhanced the social contract between academics and the public That could easily be said of the March for Science Except now its not just a limb but the entire tree thats in peril Ivan Oransky Distinguished Writer In Residence Arthur Carter Journalism Institute New York University and Adam Marcus Adjunct Faculty for

62,2017/2/7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/madelaine-dangelo/how-to-minimize-risks-and_b_14635990.html,How to Minimize Risks and Maximize Returns in Art Investments,Many investors interested in alternative assets often shy away from art due to the overwhelming amount of risks and responsibilities that come with acquiring investment grade art In this article we identify these risks and tell you how investing in art through Arthena will make you want to start today Comparables Experience and Costs Needless to say investment grade art is not the stock market or the real estate market where you can compare prices of one asset to another With art assets the ability to determine the legitimacy and the price comes with expertise this barrier makes it difficult for the traditional investor to confidently invest When evaluating a work of art art appraisers look for Authenticity condition rarity provenance and value Art appraisers expertise can charge anywhere between 50 dollars to several hundreds of dollars an hour and not all have equivalent experiences Additional time is needed to ween out truly experienced art appraisers from those who are not How can Arthena help By investing through Arthena we take away all the troubles of doing your own research determining which work to purchase placing the right bid and hiring the right appraiser At Arthena we use our very own regression analysis to determine works of art to purchase for investment purposes We organize artworks with similar core characteristics into logical groups according to their specific criteria in accordance with USPAP Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice guidelines which is also known as a IRS appraisal The characteristics include artist genre date range content materials size coloration and style among others Then Arthena targets works by artists that have shown appreciation over the past 5 years and are projected to grow by 20 YoY over the next five or the lifetime of the fund From storage to insurance Arthena takes all these burdens away from the traditional art investor By investing a minimum of 10k into our funds we handle every troublesome task when it comes to acquiring a work of art Just sit back and watch your investment grow Illiquidity Generally the art market is relatively illiquid in comparison to traditional assets such as equities and stocks Therefore art assets are ideal for longterm investments That being said there is varying liquidity within the art market itself Determined by the difference between the ask and bid price the lower the bid price from the ask price the more illiquid the asset is The greater the bid is from the ask price the more liquid it is Let Arthena identify the art markets most liquid assets Arthena acquires works in the emerging PWC and Modern market sectors which in total account for over 70 of the US market and have shown the highest rate of growth over the past 10 years Art market analysts have identified the most liquid sector of the art market are works of art under 250000 Arthena confirms that the artist and art work fit our growth metrics rate at 1 or above for Sharpe Ratio to confirm that it is a high growth investment with low volatility and determine its maximum acquisition price Lack of Data Many reports have noted upon the lack of transparency in the art market As a result companies have created indices such as Mei Moses and Artnet index to amend this problem Nonetheless these indices bring in a new set of issues Such indices as the two mentioned do not encompass the entire art market For example Mei Mosess data lies primarily on numbers from Sothebys and Christies negating their online sales as well as other auction houses and private sales Another problem is that some indexes rely heavily on repeat sales but does not include bought in lots which variates some data How Arthena operates through transparency As such Arthena acquires works at auction for increased price transparency to the benefit of our investors and our methodology When works from Arthenas index of artists appear at auction Arthena uses regression modeling to determine maximum acquisition price Once acquired investors can view their art collection through Arthenas online dashboard allowing our clients to have full access into their investments Stock market vs art market performance Multiple art market analysts have determined that the art market has a low correlation to the stock market while other analysts have deemed that there is still a certain level of correlation between the two because of the notion that investors would only spend disposable income on collectibles and luxury assets when the market is bullish rather than vice versa Regardless the art market has proven itself to be a great store of wealth especially during times of economic uncertainty Notably it only took the art market 16 months to return to prerecession levels in 2008 while the stock market took six years As such according to Deloitte Increasing awareness of art as an asset class 53 of wealth managers had a high level of awareness of developments linked to art as an asset class up from 43 in 2012 and 33 in 2011 this signals that increasing attention is being paid by the wealth management community to the art and collectibles market Deloitte and ArtTactic Art

dating in the 21st century If disappointing websites drugresistant STIs and troublingly short attention spans werent enough to make us lose our minds and possibly our libidos wer also now stuck grappling with another modern phenomenon ghosting The New York Times defines ghosting as ending a romantic relationship by cutting off all contact and ignoring the former partners attempts to reach outThis has happened to me three times in the past year Granted I dont believe it necessarily needs to be a relationshipin the traditional sense in order for one party to be ghosted It could or should also include entanglements that involved meeting up or hanging out or hooking up with someone two or more times before the other person vanished without a trace I havent been in a formal relationship in almost four years but I frequently meet guys that I find worthy of getting to know better both with and without my clothes on and the exchanges that result from those interactions are meaningful to me in one way or another at least meaningful enough to want some closure if or when they end After investing some time and energy and possibly saliva or other body fluids in another person its disconcerting when they suddenly disappear Of course if youre only been on one or two dateshowever you want to define that term with someone and at the end of your time together neither of you reaches out to the other thats not ghosting Thats just lifeAnd I understand that dating is hard and that finding someone who ticks or if wer really lucky tickles all of our boxes is virtually impossible but I still perhaps naively cling to the perhaps now radical and totally outdated idea that its a mature move to give someone a heads up if your going to stop talking or seeing or fucking them So in light of my experiences over the past year here are a few humble and totally unscientific thoughts on ghosting 1 Just dont do it Be an adult and send a text that reads something like Hey Glad we hung out but Im just not feeling a connection Stay awesomeor whatever other generic and possibly hurtful or patronizing or maybe just uncomfortable but at least emotionally clear and instructive language you want to use Ill respect you for it even if it bums me out and that way neither of us has to dread randomly running into the other at Whole Foods or at that bar with all those vintage pinball machines that I stupidly and regretfully introduced you to because I thought you were cool or at least we wont experience more than the usual basic human level of dread that accompanies those kinds of surprise social interactions 2 If you do it do not as two of the three guys who originally ghosted me have done start texting me again three to four weeks later and pretend like nothing happened as if you unexpectedly slipped into a coma and then suddenly woke up again or went on a hot air balloon trip around the world and didnt have access to your phone and just forgot to tell me The only thing worse than ghosting is rematerializing a month later and I mean worse for both of us because at that point Ive had all that time to think about how bad your taste in music actually is or question a million other questionable things you told me in our short time together and now that Ive thought about it I dont want to see you again 3 Being ghosted made me realize Ive probably ghosted guys in the pastand now that Im publishing this piece Im guessing one or two or 74 of you will come forward and say as much If I ghosted you Im sorry I was an asshole I was immature And I was probably scared of hurting your feelings or just didnt know how to verbalize why I didnt want to see you again Chances are it was something innocuous and had nothing to do with your character And Im sure if you asked any of the guys who ghosted me they say exactly the same things But that doesnt excuse it and going forward Im vowing taking my own advice no matter how awkward it might feel 4 Human beings are finicky creatures and whats more as our cultural ideas about and understanding of what dating and relationships and couples and families look like continues to shift and destabilizelinking up and breaking apart is probably only going to get trickier These days many of us arent looking to get married or have kids or at least arent looking to get married and have kids the way our parents or our grandparentsdid and so the way we think about how we enter and exit relationships is mutating and not always in ideal ways which means we have to be even more mindful of our inactions 5 Communicating is hard and getting harderAs much as I think the guys who ghosted me suck I get it And in many ways aside from reminding me to treat others the way Id like to be treated being ghosted also has made me rethink who and what Im looking for in a partner or a fuck buddy or just someone I want to go and have a donut with Whats more its made me rethink how I communicate with other human beings in general and reevaluate what the best way is to express myself and my needs and my desires to friends and family and colleagues too Email and texts make it easy to send a message but we have to stop to think about the quality of those messages And are those forms of communication appropriate for what we need to sayWhat is the value of face to face contact and experiencing the world offline What are the best ways to grow a relationship and how often do I rely on technology as a crutch to deal with or get out of something These are all questions that have been pacing the hallways in my head lately and it feels good or at least productive to think about them 6 Ghosting aside theres something kind of nice about dating as a 38yearold because I know what I want better than I did when I was 25 or even 32 and I put up with less shit And if in the end someone doesnt text me back the truth is Im totally happy to spend Friday night watching the Great British Bakeoffall by myself maybe if Im being totally honest even happier

establishment will stop these women from fulfilling their callingThe Orthodox Union one of the largestnetworks of Orthodox Jewish synagogues in America recently adopted a policy that bans women from serving as clergy Opinions about whether women should be allowed to serve as clergy have caused some division within Americas Modern Orthodox Jewish community The religious establishment including the OUs counterpart the Rabbinical Council of Americais strongly opposed to womens ordinationOn the other hand some OU synagogues have embraced the idea of women clergy The new policy attempts to clear up the confusion But despite the enforcement of this glass ceiling Orthodox women who have felt the pull to serve as spiritual leaders arent backing away from their calling Rabba Sara Hurwitz is the cofounder and Dean of Yeshivat Maharat anOrthodox Jewish seminary that ordains women as clergy The school has graduated 14 female clergy and 28 others are currently students Hurwitz told The Huffington Post that nine of the their graduates are currently employed in synagogues She said students remain committed to learning teaching being a pastoral presence for people in their time joy and vulnerability and being a role model for otherstheir reaction to the policy is to keep marching forwards fulfilling their passion to become clergyshe wrote in an email The OUs decision comes down to a difference in opinion about Gods will for men and women According to a statement OU leaders said that they had been approached by Orthodox rabbis and lay leadership for definitive guidance about womens ordination The OU placed the question in front of a group of seven modern Orthodox rabbis After months of reviews and forums with community members the panel concluded that more should be done to encourage women towards leadership positions However their interpretation of Jewish law found that men and women havedifferent gender roles and obligations when it comes to serving in a synagogue OU leaders argued that the idea of gender equality in religious practice inexorably clasheswith the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish scripture In their worldview individual autonomy must always submit to the will of God as interpreted by rabbinic leaders The rabbis agreed that women can serve as administrators educators and counselors They can even advise other women about Jewish law as it relates to marriage sexuality and womens health But on the matter of ordination the rabbis concluded that women werent allowed As a result the OU adopted a policy on February 1 that discouragesmember synagogues from employingwomen clergy or allowing women to perform tasks typically associated with clergy � such as officiating at significant lifecycle events delivering sermons from the pulpit and serving as a synagogues primary religious teacher Instead of focusing on what women are prohibited from doing the leaders asked the community to focus on what women are allowed to do Women must be encouraged to share their Torah knowledge and their enthusiasm and wisdom with the broader communitythe leaders said in a statement Let us focus our energy and communal creativity on increasing and enhancing the contributions that women make to our shuls and communities rather than being consumed with limitationsBut some female Orthodox clergy are determined not to let these restrictions stop

keep doing her job I am grateful to have an extremely supportive community and so this decision does not affect me personally However some of my colleagues are personally affected and this decision caused them a lot of upset and worryshe told The Huffington Post in an email therefore my top reaction is one of angerThat these rabbis made this decision without considering the effects it would have on the women who are currently serving as clergy or who are training to serve is disgracefulThe OUs statement does not explicitly state whether the rabbinic panel listened to ordained womens voices

women artists from around the world interpreting ancient poetryWallada bint alMustakfi was an Andalusian poet who lived and wrote in 11thcentury Spainsometimes sewing her verses onto the trim of her transparent tunics and wearing them around town The daughter of a caliph Wallada eventually inherited her fathers palace and transformed it into a literary hall where shedmentor young women of all backgrounds in poetry and the arts Her poems mixed themes of spiritual worship and erotic yearning sometimes exalting her beloved other times scolding the lovers who had done her wrong She wrote I am made for higher goals and by Allah I am going my way with pride I allow my lover to touch my cheek And bestow my kiss to him who craves itWhen Irish born Londonbased actress R��is��n OLoughlin unexpectedly encountered Walladas poems last year she was struck by how contemporary they felt they read like the best pop lyricsOLoughlin said in a statement Short and sweet in their intense defiance desire lovesick longing pride and funIn an email to The Huffington PostOLoughlin said they reminded her of the songs of contemporary songstress FKA Twigs who infuses her erotic lyrics with hints of spiritual reverence Astounded by her discovery OLoughlin began to research other women poets from the ancient Arab world She landed upon the collection of Abdullah alUdhari comprised of verses written by women between the 7th and 12th centuries Like Wallada the other ancient poets spun verses that praised pleasures both carnal and divine with the same fearless breathOne piece by 11thcentury poet Itimad alRumaykiyya reads I urge you to come faster than the wind to mount my breast and firmly dig and plough my body and dont let go until youre flushed me thriceLyrics like these lavish and unapologetic contradict the persistent patriarchal myths that cast women and especially women of Muslim faith as submissive or silent These ancient Arabic poets revealed that for millennia women of various backgrounds classes and faiths have expressed their feelings and beliefs in no uncertain terms through passages that vibrate with conviction and lust sometimes directed toward another person and alternately toward life itself I was really attracted to the poems in part because they didnt have any agendaOLoughlin told HuffPost Today the idea of empowerment is sold to us Its become an advertising tool used to sell dresses or soap These artists their way of speaking just felt really free They felt like celebrations of lifeInspired by these visionary poets whose words still resonate centuries laterOLoughlin brainstormed how to usher this littleknown pocket of ancient erotic feminist literature into contemporary discussions in a time so many of the stereotypes regarding femininity Islam and the Arab World still persist She decided to match presentday artists with their poetic predecessors inviting women of today to create visual testimonies to accompany the written works that came before them OLoughlin collected 24 total poems from Arabic women poets most are Muslim though one is Jewish and one predates Islam She recruited two female contemporary artists from different cultural and artistic traditions to craft an artistic responses to each poem The resulting exhibition called radical Love Female Lustfeatures 48 artworks made by women around the world approximately half of whom are of Arab descent Hailing from countries including Syria Saudi Arabia Israel Lebanon Egypt Russia America Pakistan and Ghana the featured artists use ancient Arabic poetry as a point of departure visualizing desire and worship in a dizzying array of manifestations The show will take place at the Crypt Gallery in London a former burial ground located beneath a church According to OLoughlin Here the words of these poets who have been silenced are given voice again and in doing so the desire for life that is present in the female rises in the work of the modern artistThe curator funded the entire exhibition herself and is currently crowdfunding on Generosity to help with the cost She hopes to earn enough to divide all proceeds from the show between the participating artists and the Global Fund for Womenhelping Syrian refugees who have relocated to Lebanon The image above a print by by Saudi artist Hend alMansour was inspired by the poet Juml a young Bedouin woman who in 9thcentury Iraq served as a concubine to poet Idris Ibn Abi Hafsah AlMansour riffed off the style of the Arabic storybook Maqamat BadialZaman alHamadhaniadding splashes of neon pink and her heroines salty expression Another work by Dublinbased photographer Deborah Sheedy titled I Keep my Passion to Myselfwas inspired by a poem by Zahra Her airy blackandwhite photo depicts a woman spinning in a white dress appearing like something between an embodied human and imagined chimera The photoblurred and bubbling from the edges transforms what photographers often construe as mistakes into opportunities for additional experimentation and play The motley assemblage of artists have a few things in commonurgency a desire to express core emotions like strength vulnerability and love they are a deliberate and timeless resistance to the silencing and patronizing of femalesOLoughlin added Whatever external restraints were placed on these women they retained a vitality and independence of spirit a powerful tonic to these troubling timesOLoughlin originally began researching ancient Arabic poetry in 2015 Before Brexit before Trumps election and before the presidentsexecutive order barring immigrants from seven Muslimmajority nations Islamophobia and the xenophobic myths that such thinking engenders were palpable then I was shocked by Brexit and I was shocked by Donald Trump being elected she said But I was aware that people were being reduced to their ethnicity or their faithThrough her exhibition OLoughlin hoped to reveal the futility of defining human beings through such sweeping labelsdemonstrating the depth and difference that exist within every cultural category Its crazy that the word Muslimis being described to define millions of people who are from different places and culturesOLoughlin continued people from Pakistan or Palestine or Algeria come from such distinct cultures And every single woman has a different relationship to GodSubsequently the featured artists in her exhibition do not disclose their faiths alongside their work That OLoughlin expressed is an aspect of themselves they are not compelled to explain to anyone they are women

70,2017/2/7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/renee-fisher/a-valentine-for-potus_b_14631164.html,A Valentine For POTUS,Dear POTUS This year Im sending you a Valentine not because I love you or respect you but because I love my country And you are the dulyelected symbol of that country You may not know that I love my country since Im not in the prolife movement I dont attend church fear immigrants or verbally wave the flag every chance I get Im not even Christian which I suspect is becoming ground zero for patriotism In fact I pretty much dont fit any of the recent descriptions used for those who love our country My love of country stems instead from deep unwavering gratitude Gratitude that my parents were allowed to emigrate here and that this country made room for them Gratitude that I was given a childhood that was dramatically different than theirs Gratitude that my life choices were those of people who have enough food to eat a home to live in and a government that protects them and not hunts them down I had only to decide which clothes to wear for school that day which homework assignment should be done first and which childrens shows I would look forward to seeing on TV over the weekend These were decisions my parents never got to consider when they were growing up I also love my country because my experience growing up was that people of different religions living together was entirely normal My friends were Jewish Protestant Catholic We attended the same school borrowed books from the same library watched movies on Saturday morning at the same theater My parents did not experience this Because of their religion they lived only where the government allowed them to live Their lives were so insular that they never learned the languages of the countries in which they lived This is what Id like you to understand that because of who I am and because of the circumstances of my family history I love my country You and I speak the same language and we may use the same terms but I may mean something a bit different than you when I do so For example prolife My belief is that life is sacred and that being prolife means that we have an obligation to those like my parents who seek asylum within our borders And we have an obligation to those who live here now to be inclusive Prolife means not shutting them out either economically socially or educationally I do not believe that they are here to suck us dry or kill us I believe they are like my parents here to have a chance at a better life radical Islamic terrorism a favorite term of yours Youll be happy to know that I believe radical Islamic terrorism exists and that it is a threat to us and to the world I also believe radical nonIslamic terrorism exists It has resulted in Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing Dylann Roof and the Charleston Church shooting Adam Lanza and the Newtown School shooting Charles Roberts and the Amish school shooting Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and the Columbine High School massacre The list goes on and on Terrorism no matter its motivation is unacceptable governmentrun education monopoly Democracies depend on the educational system they provide their citizens Corporations that are monopolies have consumers at their mercy and may set prices to increase profit They dont have to consider the welfare of the people who use their products or services Education as a monopoly ensures that common standards are upheld They are beholden to the people who use their services There is a big difference between a business and an educational system People of means will always have the option of sending their children to private school just as people of faith will always have the option of sending their children to faithbased school And people will and should have the option of homeschooling or sending their children to charter schools But none of these alternatives should impact in any way whatsoever on the public school system that the vast majority of Americans attend Alternatives mean choice not the standard fake news I agree wholeheartedly that fake news exists But in this era of unlimited avenues in which people can gather information its irresponsible to accept any news no matter where it comes from without checking sources If you limit yourself solely to one source or one way of thinking you become vulnerable to manipulation And that is a very dangerous place to be A free society is based on a free press It is not up to any leader of this country to decide what people should read andor listen to It is up to us the peopleto do due diligence to weed through news sources in order to make ourselves betterinformed citizens I also have definitions that differ from yours regarding what it would take to make America great again and make the inner cities safe and keep our borders safe I will happily share them with you if youd like So heres your Valentine POTUS from a gratefultobehere patriot of this amazing country I suspect that no matter what path you choose to lead this country down for the foreseeable future I will make my opinion known I will continue to exercise the right that was not given to my parents And I will continue to love this country as much as anyone possibly can and to get chills whenever I say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the national anthem

addressing ParliamentCommons Speaker John Bercow has defended voicing his opposition to Donald Trump addressing Parliament His comments including accusing the US president of racism and sexism had been made honestly and honourably and were within his remit he told MPs Several Conservatives have criticised the Speaker one saying his career could be in jeopardy and another that he had damaged the national interest Downing Street called his comments a matter for Parliament The US president has accepted an invitation from the Queen for a state visit to the UK which can include an address to both Houses of Parliament later this year However responding to a point of order in the Commons on Monday Mr Bercow said he was opposed to Mr Trump speaking to MPs and peers as some other international leaders have done He said it was not an automatic right but an earned honour to applause from Labour and SNP MPs Questioned in the Commons on Tuesday about his remarks he replied The House has always understood that the chair has a role in these matters He added I was honestly and honourably seeking to discharge my responsibilities to the House Mr Bercow said it was time to move on to other matters Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth said there had been a rather subdued aspect among his partys MPs when Mr Bercow had spoken He added I do hope that you will help us to ensure that we can have full confidence in your impartiality because thats the way for the House to proceed The relationship between the United Kingdom and United States is an extremely important one Sir Gerald also said However Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Commons owed Mr Bercow a debt of gratitude for deciding that in this case such an invitation should not be supported by this House And SNP MP Alex Salmond who had several runins with Mr Trump when he was Scottish First Minister told Mr Bercow If ever a statement deserved clapping then yours did yesterday Mr Bercow is one of three key holders to Westminster Hall where Mr Trumps predecessor Barack Obama spoke in 2011 along with the Speaker of the House of Lords Lord Fowler and the Lord Great Chamberlain a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster All three must agree in order for an address to take place there Lord Fowler addressed peers on Tuesday saying Mr Bercow had not informed him ahead of voicing his opinion on Mr Trump adding that Mr Bercow had told him he was genuinely sorry for this He added I dont intend to argue the case for or against Mr Trumps visit Thats not my role as Speaker But let me say I have spent the last 30 years campaigning against discrimination particularly against LGBT people and people with HIVAids As speaker Mr Bercow is the highest authority of the House of Commons and must remain politically impartial Several senior Conservatives have been highly critical of his comments One unnamed Tory MP and former cabinet member told the BBC he must be close to standing down as Speaker while another said his remarks had gone way beyond what is acceptable Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said When he loses support for what was a very partisan moment I think his position will become more and more in jeopardy Crispin Blunt the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee said Mr Bercow was going to have to deal with the consequences of his comments He added that the Speaker whos meant to referee all of this should keep himself above that What is a state visit Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told Sky News It was a performance it was John Bercow playing to the gallery and I think it was damaging to the national interest I think it is regrettable that he did it Fellow Conservative Nadhim Zahawi who has been critical of Mr Trumps travel ban on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries said the Speaker prided himself on his neutrality and to become the story was a bad place to be He said Mr Bercow had opened himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after allowing other controversial leaders like the Chinese president to speak and urged him to explain his thinking to MPs Meanwhile Joe Wilson a Congressman for Mr Trumps republican Party told the BBCs Newsnight programme Mr Bercows interjection had been very disappointing If ever in recent years theres been a more proBritish president of the United States its Donald Trump he said Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bercow had abused his position and that to have expressed his opinions in the way he did devalues this great office But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who has called for the state visit to be postponed welcomed the intervention while Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Trump was not welcome A petition to withdraw the invitation to the US president and another one backing the visit will be debated by MPs later this month No date for Mr Trumps visit has been announced

admitting the current market is brokenThe government has vowed to build more affordable houses and help people buy and rent after admitting the current market is broken The new housing strategy for England includes giving councils powers to pressurise developers to start building on land they own Ministers also pledged to make renting more familyfriendly with longer tenancies offered Labour called the measures announced feeble beyond belief The government says at least 250000 new homes are needed each year to keep pace with demand and councils and developers need to get real to the scale of the challenge Mr Javid set out the details of the housing White Paper in a statement to MPs with measures including Socalled starter homes championed by former Prime Minister David Cameron will be aimed at households that need them most those with combined incomes of less than 80000 or 90000 in London Starter homes are new homes built for firsttime buyers between 23 and 40 years old and sold at least 20 below market value The maximum price after the discount has been applied is 250000 outside London and 450000 in the capital Under the new proposals starter home buyers will need a mortgage to stop cash buyers and some or all of the discount will have to be repaid if the property is resold within 15 years to reduce the risk of speculation A proposal that 20 of all larger developments had to be starter homes is to be dropped and replaced with a clear expectation that at least 10 of developments will be affordable home ownership units The 22yearolds who bought their own home without mum and dads help Ruby Willard a recruitment consultant and engineer Sam Bardell bought a 182200 twobedroom terraced house in Havant Hampshire last year They took advantage of the governments Help to Buy Isa but to save for the 18000 deposit it was a case of being quite tight she says When we decided we were going to buy I thought Im not going to spend money elsewhere when I dont need to I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn 55000 overall which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage Read how other 20somethings managed to do it Mr Javid said Walk down your local high street today and theres one sight youre almost certain to see young people faces pressed against the estate agents window trying and failing to find a home they can afford With prices continuing to skyrocket if we dont act now a whole generation could be left behind We need to do better and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system The housing market in this country is broken and the solution means building many more houses in the places that people want to live Mr Javid admitted there was no one single magic bullet and there had to be a proper conversation about housing need Ministers have admitted the government is behind schedule in its efforts to build one million new homes in England by 2020 For Labour shadow housing minister John Healey said We hoped for better and we needed better His disappointment will desperately disappoint millions of people struggling to cope with a housing crisis It was feeble beyond belief He added We were promised a White Paper we are presented with a white flag The Lib Dems criticised the utterly vacuous proposals for not mentioning the governments stated aim of a million new homes by 2020 a target ministers have insisted they are still aiming for BBC home editor Mark Easton This government seems to speak with two voices on housing the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bulletpoints is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed Ministers now accept England needs 250000 new homes every year they have described the housing market as broken and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a realistic plan to achieve that Read more from Mark Former Conservative housing minister Grant Shapps told the BBCs Daily Politics the problem would not be solved simply by slotting in a few more homes in converted former industrial sites He added Housing ministers over the years have come out with documents or bills and the truth is none of them are going to make much difference and I dont suppose this will make that much difference either The reason is this unless you build literally two three million more homes then youre not going to solve the problem The Local Government Association said the White Paper contained some encouraging signs on increasing housing supply and affordability It welcomed the new flexibility around starter homes and called for new power and funding to allow councils to build affordable homes directly The Campaign to Protect Rural England welcomed what it said was a focus on addressing current failings rather than meddling with the planning system We are pleased that ministers have recognised that weakening the Green Belt is unnecessary said chief executive Shaun Spiers But with 360000 houses already proposed for Green Belt land the government needs to do much more to uphold national policy and stop councils releasing it for development Daniel Bentley editorial director at the think tank Civitas said The problem is not sites with planning permission standing idle except in limited circumstances It is with sites that are being developed but too slowly to get ahead of demand and make any difference to the affordability of housing Graeme Brown interim chief executive of the homelessness charity Shelter said The White Paper poses the right questions What we

93,2017/2/6,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38650976,Why the falling cost of light matters,Back in the mid1990s an economist called William Nordhaus conducted a series of simple experiments with lightBack in the mid1990s an economist called William Nordhaus conducted a series of simple experiments with light First he used a prehistoric technology he lit a wood fire But Prof Nordhaus also had a piece of hitech equipment with him a Minolta light meter He burned 20lb 9kg of wood kept track of how long it burned for and carefully recorded the dim flickering firelight with his meter Next he bought a Roman oil lamp fitted it with a wick and filled it with coldpressed sesame oil He lit the lamp and watched the oil burn down again using the light meter to measure its soft even glow Bill Nordhauss open wood fire had burned for just three hours on 9kg of wood But a mere eggcup of oil burned all day and more brightly and controllably Why did he do this He wanted to understand the economic significance of the light bulb But Prof Nordhaus also wanted to illuminate a difficult issue for economists how to keep track of inflation the changing cost of goods and services 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world It is broadcast on the BBC World Service You can find more information about the programmes sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast To see why this is difficult consider the price of travelling from say Lisbon in Portugal to Luanda in Angola When that journey was first made by Portuguese explorers it would have been an epic expedition possibly taking months Later by steam ship it would have taken a few days then by plane a few hours An economic historian could start by tracking the price of passage on the ship but once an air route has opened up which price do you look at Maybe you simply switch to the airline ticket price once more people start flying than sailing But flying is a different service faster more convenient If more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled It was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires oil lamps and light meters He wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial using the stateoftheart technology of different ages illumination Light is measured in lumens or lumenhours A candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns A typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that Imagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days Those 60 hours of work would produce 1000 lumen hours of light That is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim flickering light instead Of course light is not the only reason to burn fires they also help keep you warm cook your food and scare off wild animals If you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up Thousands of years ago better options came along candles from Egypt and Crete and oil lamps from Babylon Their light was steadier and more controllable but still prohibitively expensive In a diary entry of May 1743 the president of Harvard University the Reverend Edward Holyoake noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb 35kg of tallow candles Six months later he noted Candles all gone And those were the summer months The iPhone at 10 How the smartphone became so smart The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the barcode changed retailing Nor were these the cleanburning paraffin wax candles we use today The wealthiest could afford beeswax but most people even the Harvard president used tallow candles stinking smoking sticks of animal fat Making them involved heating up animal fat and dipping and redipping wicks into the molten lard It was pungent and timeconsuming work According to Prof Nordhauss research if you set aside one whole week a year to spend 60 hours devoted exclusively to making candles or earning the money to buy them that would enable you to burn a single candle for just two hours and 20 minutes every evening Things improved a little as the 18th and 19th Centuries unfolded Candles were made of spermaceti the milkhued oily gloop harvested from dead sperm whales American founding father Ben Franklin loved the strong white light they gave off and the way they may be held in the hand even in hot weather without softening and noted that they last much longer While the new candles were pleasing they were also pricey George Washington calculated that burning a single spermaceti candle for five hours a night all year would cost him 8 or well over 1000 820 in todays money A few decades later gas lamps and kerosene lamps helped to lower costs They also saved the sperm whale from extinction But they too were basically an expensive hassle They dripped smelt and set fire to things Then something changed That something was the light bulb By 1900 one of Thomas Edisons carbon filament bulbs would provide you with 10 days of bright continuous illumination 100 times as bright as a candle for the money you could earn with our 60hour week of hard labour By 1920 that same week of labour would pay for more than five months continuous light from tungsten filament bulbs By 1990 it was 10 years A couple of years after that thanks to compact fluorescent bulbs it was more than five times longer The labour that had once produced the equivalent of 54 minutes of quality light now produced 52 years And modern LED lights continue to get cheaper and cheaper Switch off a light bulb for an hour and you are saving illumination that would have cost our ancestors all week to create It would have taken Benjamin Franklins contemporaries all afternoon But someone in a rich industrial economy today could earn the money to buy that illumination in a fraction of a second And of course our light bulbs are clean safe and controllable no flicker pig fat stink or risk of fire The light bulb has become an icon of innovation It has transformed our society into one where we can work read sew or play whenever we want to regardless of how dark the night has become But the price of light alone tells a fascinating story it has fallen by a factor of 500000 far faster than official inflation statistics suggest A thing that was once too precious to use is now too cheap to notice Tim Harford writes the Financial

96,2017/2/6,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38877091,Do longest flight records matter,Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current nonstop commercial route after completing a journey from Doha to AucklandQatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current nonstop commercial route after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland Flight QR920 landed on Monday after 16 hours and 23 minutes slightly quicker than expected The Boeing 777200LR jet was showered with water cannons on arrival a tradition for airlines on new routes Carriers like to talk up these records but how are they measured and do they really matter Longest time or furthest distance are the two key distinctions to make but its not as simple as it might sound The distance between two cities doesnt vary for airlines of course but they might choose to take alternative routes For example a carrier might choose to avoid flying over certain countries which can alter how far a plane flies from point A to point B And airlines have been known to take unconventional routes In October last year Air India flew Delhi to San Francisco by crossing the Pacific rather than the Atlantic a direction switch which added an extra 1400km to the journey making the 15127km trip the longest ever nonstop flight by distance By comparison Qatars new route is 14535km But regardless of the route flight time is dependent on headwinds or tailwinds For example Qatars return leg from Auckland to Doha is expected to take about 18 hours because of headwinds And though Air India went the long way round favourable tailwinds meant the journey took about twoandahalf hours less than its conventional route The longest flying time doesnt always correspond with the longest distance says Ellis Taylor of Flightglobal Of course from a passenger perspective the flying time is probably the best measurement Recordbreaking flights may make headlines But new longhaul flights mean nothing if theyre treated as a standalone route says Mr Taylor Rather its what a new route brings to the airlines existing network On its own it wouldnt be viable to fly between Auckland and Doha but Qatar is focusing on the passengers from Auckland going on to Europe Africa the US or elsewhere says Mr Taylor In that light even though it may take some time for the route to stack up from a profit perspective it may help the economics of its wider network Historically most of the major longhaul routes have been serviced by legacy airlines like Singapore Airlines and Australias Qantas But adding new routes have allowed newer airlines like Qatar and perhaps most notably Emirates to expand their business very rapidly Its also about reach for Middle East airlines striving to outdo each other says Geoffrey Thomas of Airlineratingscom Longest flight records will continue to change hands as airlines launch new routes and the range capability of aircraft improves Last year for example Qantas revealed it would fly direct between Perth and London from March 2018 a flight that will take 17 hours The price of fuel and the types of planes which airlines buy will be the determining factors in opening new routes With the arrival of the 7778X in 2022 new records such as flights from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London will be set says Mr Thomas The 7778X will be the ultimate long haul airliner But remember for routes to be viable they also require people to buy tickets That depends on passengers being willing to sit in their seats for 16 17 or maybe 18 hours at a time How long that desire will last especially for travellers cramped up in economy is something airlines will monitor carefully

socalled judge is making the job very difficultDonald Trump says he is defending the United States from terrorism but a socalled judge is making the job very difficult But the judge in halting the presidents controversial executive order on immigration said he was making sure President Trumps actions follow the law That sets two theoretically equal branches of the government against one another and could bring about a crisis The separation of powers is crucial to understanding how the US is governed The countrys constitution established its treasured system of checks and balances where the different branches of government hold equal authority and offset one another The federal governments power is split into three distinct parts the executive branch which includes the president and his cabinet the legislative branch Congress which makes the laws and the judiciary This works well most of the time with each branch cooperating with the next But with the president in open conflict with another branch there are fears that an impasse could be reached That could lead to a constitutional crisis a scenario in which the situation cannot be resolved particularly after Mr Trump seemed to openly question the judges authority The Presidents hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing it is dangerous Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy from the Senate judiciary committee said He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis There are about 700 federal district judges in the US the type facing down the presidents order Unlike state court judges these men and women are part of the federal court system along with the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals Day to day its the 94 District Courts which deal with interpretation of US laws treaties and public officials powers devolved to them from the Supreme Court The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases in Law and Equity arising under this Constitution the Laws of the United States and Treaties made or which shall be made But the courts do not offer opinions on government policy unless they are asked they only interpret law when a case is brought before them The other two branches of government make and enforce the laws and the judicial branch interprets the laws when there is a dispute That is the issue here a presidential executive order has all the force of law and is subject to the same checks Those judicial powers have been used many times before Barack Obama faced stumbling blocks in 2015 when he attempted to use an executive order to grant a reprieve to undocumented immigrants and George W Bush faced similar battles over detainees in Guantanamo Bay It is true that district judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate Judge James Robart for example the socalled judge of Mr Trumps Twitter criticism was appointed by President George W Bush and confirmed in 2004 But Mr Trump cant fire judges Thats because the founding fathers of the United States created a system to protect the judiciary from interference Only Congress can remove a federal judge from office through impeachment which involves both the House and Senate It is the same system used to remove a president This article three protection is in practical terms very rigid Only eight judges have been convicted in an impeachment trial in the entire history of the United States The end result is that federal judges usually serve until they choose to retire or until death In effect two of the countrys three branches of government are in conflict and neither can remove the other Inside the mind of Donald Trump Which executive actions will have the most impact Tech world caught between Trump and a liberal place The Supreme Court as the name implies has ultimate power in the judiciary the other courts are inferior to it In this case the government could have taken its appeal against the district rulings straight to the Supreme Court and may still do so Nine seats make up the court Four were appointed by Democrats two by President Clinton and two by President Obama Four were appointed by Republican Presidents George W Bush George Bush Snr and Ronald Reagan One seat is vacant following the death of Antonin Scalia Just as with the other federal courts though the Supreme Court is protected from interference But there are currently only eight judges on the Supreme Court Four were appointed by a Democrat and four by a Republican with one vacant seat waiting to be filled by Mr Trumps nominee which could swing the balance of power Congress could break any deadlock that crops up between the president and the judiciary by creating a law that overturns his decision or even impeaching a president or judge Since Mr Trumps Republican party holds a majority there action against the president seems unlikely And the independence of the courts is so essential to the US way of governing that moving to attack judges on behalf of the president would be a drastic step Nonetheless with two of the three powers in conflict the decision may fall to Congress eventually unless Mr Trump modifies his order That may be the most prudent move in keeping with his predecessors who have often backed off in the face of judicial opposition For now though Mr Trump just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril and shows no signs of changing his mind

week has been no less hectic Despite the mass protests of week one and falling approval ratings the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbookPresident Trumps first week in office was widely regarded as a whirlwind His second week has been no less hectic Despite the mass protests of week one and falling approval ratings the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbook In a divided America many people are repelled by the agenda and tone of this administration while many others are pleased that their president is taking a bold stand and getting things done Here are five key things from week two in Trumpland On Friday a week after his inauguration President Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days banning Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspending arrivals from seven Muslimmajority countries for 90 days The immediacy of the announcement which Mr Trump said was necessary to not allow any lag time for bad dudes to sneak in caused widespread confusion at airports around the world Families were separated and even Green Card holders from the affected countries were initially included in the ban An Iraqi who put his life at risk as an interpreter for the US army was among hundreds of people detained at airports Around the world travellers were prevented from boarding planes and in some cases were pulled off flights Vetted refugees waiting to travel to the US despaired An Iranborn BBC reporter with British citizenship was among those temporarily detained Demonstrators flocked to airports in protest with many lawyers offering their services for free and filing emergency motions to have people released Mr Trump said the restrictions were required so new security measures could be put in place to protect America from possible terrorist attacks Things were working out very nicely he said Steve Gruber a popular talkshow host in Michigan summed up the mood among many Trump voters Listeners he said are encouraged that a politician albeit a new one is actually doing the things he said he would do Several courts moved to block parts of the order being implemented but reports said that border officers in some places were not complying with the rulings As condemnation grew including from a few top Republicans many foreign governments and major US companies the White House insisted it was not a Muslim ban pointing to the many Muslimmajority countries not involved Thousands join protests across UK But former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani undermined that claim admitting to Fox News that Mr Trump had previously asked him how to legally implement a ban on Muslims He said however that the ban implemented was based on danger not religion Sean Spicer the White Houses combative press secretary blasted journalists for reporting it as a travel ban even though his boss used that very wording on Twitter Meanwhile the world tried to figure out the unique language on display at protests in Scotland The immigration orders fallout dominated headlines for most of this week This has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a notreadyforprimetime White House our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote Amateur hour at the White House But President Trumps supporters think hes doing a great job The former reality TV star now in the White House was this week finally given a chance to fire someone In the middle of the furore over the immigration ban acting attorney general Sally Yates ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce President Trumps executive order Within hours she was dismissed and accused by President Trump of betraying her department and being weak on borders Some observers and journalists asked whether the dismissal would have a chilling effect across government But the White House said justice department lawyers had deemed the order legal and thus Ms Yates was not fulfilling her duty The move came on the heels of other comments from the administration suggesting that dissent from officials would not be tolerated As news spread on Monday that hundreds of US diplomats around the world were planning to use a dissent channel to argue that the immigration restrictions would not make the US safer Sean Spicer said they should either get with the programme or they can go That seemed like a pretty direct message to US government employees with independent views On Tuesday evening at a White House ceremony Donald Trump unveiled his pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado The Democrats whom the administration has chastised for seeking to stymie them at every opportunity have hinted they will use all means at their disposal to block his confirmation in the Senate The Supreme Court has the final say on such divisive issues such as abortion gun control and gay rights Since Judge Antonin Scalia died a year ago the court has been split equally between liberal and conservative justices at four each Whoever holds the ninth seat is thus pretty significant though justices dont always split on clear ideological lines Barack Obama tried to replace Mr Scalia with a nominee of his choice but the Republicans didnt allow it given an election was forthcoming Like the late Mr Scalia the IvyLeague educated Mr Gorsuch is known to support textualism or the interpretation of law according to its plain text He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers Who is Neil Gorsuch Why is the US Supreme Court so important House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee a very hostile appointment and a very bad decision well outside the mainstream of American legal thought And of course there were more protests Stephen Bannon Donald Trumps chief strategist is a man who many people believe is behind much of what has come out of the White House in the past two weeks The former executive chairman of populist conservative news website Breitbart has been described as a rumpled rightwing agitator by the New York Times On Saturday night he was given a seat on the National Security Councils inner circle or principals committee Under the restructuring the Joint Chiefs and director of national intelligence have been told only to attend when discussions pertain to their areas The move shocked many Washington veterans Its completely unprecedented to have a political adviser as a member of that group Eliot Cohen director of the Strategic Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies told the BBC Mr Bannon has a destructive world view and has accumulated an unhealthy level of power he said describing it as an ominous move What exactly is his destructive world view Well according to the Daily Beast in 2013 Bannon said he wanted to bring everything crashing down and destroy all of todays establishment The White House tried to brush the changes off pointing to the fact that Obama adviser David Axelrod had been included in some council meetings Mr Bannon jokingly referred to himself as Darth Vader in a recent interview where he described US media as the opposition party Steve Bannon will now sit at a table where issues pertaining to US national security and thus global stability are discussed at a very very senior level Refugees are very much on President Trumps radar at the moment and it is well known that he likes to talk about deals But a phone call on the subject on Saturday between the US president and the Australian PM which was scheduled to last for an hour was cut short from the White House after just 25 minutes President Trump said the conversation with Malcolm Turnbull in which they discussed a refugee resettlement deal between the two nations was not a favourite among calls he had taken with world leaders In fact the Washington Post reported that Mr Trump described the conversation as the worst by far He appeared to be somewhat irritated by the subject matter a deal struck with the Obama administration which would see up to 1250 asylum seekers to Australia resettled in the US What next President Trump was so worked up after discussing the worst deal ever that he decided to issue a statement in his preferred manner via Twitter Mr Trump tweeted that he would study this dumb deal Later Mr Spicer gave an official version of his bosss 25minute call with Mr Turnbull He said that both leaders had emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the USAustralia relationship Mr Turnbull later thanked President Trump for agreeing to uphold the deal Trumps first week Well that was intense
99,2017/2/3,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38856081,Should you have two bins in your bathroom,Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished withOur bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem two bathroom bins The Circular Economy Taskforce who were brought together by Prince Charless Business in the Community environment charity says it could boost recycling So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms Its trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house says Jonny Hazell senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics which show that while 90 of packaging is recycled in our kitchens only 50 is being recycled in the bathroom Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin it says This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful if there is space Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled But it doesnt have to be a bin it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week it added Where has this idea come from While recycling has grown from 12 to 45 in the UK over the last decade campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and reuse rates The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment says Business in the Community Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled Recycle Now says There can also be confusion about what can or cant be recycled with bathroom products For example many people dont realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled simply make sure its empty and put the lid back on Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 65 hours so the value quickly adds up Research from the University of Exeter also found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being dirty and were less likely to recycle it Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and cant be recycled can seem offputting says Business in the Community It added There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom for example many consumers are confused by aerosols How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom A surprising amount Typical products include Plastic shampoo conditioner and shower gel bottles plastic moisturiser bottles such as for hand cream and body lotion glass face cream pots plus the cardboard packaging they come in perfume and aftershave bottles aerosols for deodorant air freshener and shaving foam bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem Every little helps is the message from environmental and recycling groups In general the less we recycle the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives said Mr Hazell Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change it added For instance it takes 75 less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference says Recycle Now It would save 135000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin On top of this if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times But what if you dont have the space for two bins There are other options Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and nonrecyclable items

this with Media playback is not supported on this device Alastair Cook says playing under another England captain will not be an issue following his resignation as skipper on Monday The 32yearold opening batsman led England a record 59 times in Tests I hope I can help the next captain with whatever he needs and drive England forward Cook told BBC Sport I cant see for me it being an issue being led by someone else I hope I can be part of it and Im really looking forward to the next stage Cook took over the England captaincy in 2012 and oversaw series victories in India and South Africa as well as Ashes victories in 2013 and 2015 However his tenure also saw a 50 Ashes whitewash in Australia in 201314 as well as a 40 series defeat in India last year He is Englands top run scorer in Test cricket with 11057 runs and 30 centuries Its a job you need to do at 100 and be committed to everything and I had to be really honest with myself Cook added I couldnt do that anymore Its not a job you can do at 95 Im sad to walk away but its the right time to do it Cooks last game in charge saw England slip to an inningsand75run defeat against India the culmination of a run of six defeats in their past eight Tests The Essex batsman who was left visibly upset by the final days collapse said after the game that he would consider his future as captain That was kind of maybe the final nail in the coffin When I left India I was pretty sure I wouldnt captain England again Cook said Admitting that isnt the easiest thing to do certainly not with my character but its the right decision for me and the right decision for the team Its such an honour to be England captain and all the bits that go with it Everything I have been involved with 59 games as captain Ive absolutely loved Giving that away was very hard Vicecaptain Joe Root is the favourite to take over the Test captaincy having led Yorkshire several times in the County Championship The 26yearold who represents England across all three formats has scored 4594 runs at an average of 5280 since making his debut in 2012 England face Test series in the summer against South Africa and the West Indies before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes The one thing I learnt throughout my career as captain is that you need those people outside looking in to help you Cook said My first couple of years I was pretty stubborn that this is the way I should do it and I didnt take that much advice outside of England Actually theres a lot of very good people who watch a lot of cricket probably more than all of the guys who are playing who can offer advice Finding people you trust that way is vitally important and they can help you Media playback is not supported on this device Cook has a win percentage of 4067 as captain the fourth best of the six captains to have led England in more than 40 Tests As captain he managed the return and subsequent ending of batsman Kevin Pietersens international career in 2014 a year which saw England lose a Test series against Sri Lanka from the penultimate delivery in Headingley and collapse to a 95run defeat by India at Lords Cook described himself as being pretty much at rock bottom following the Lords defeat but he received a warm ovation from the crowd in Southampton during Englands next Test where he made 95 When youre really doubting yourself to walk out there on that first day was really special for me It was almost spinetingling he said It surprised me to have that warmth of reception A lot of people walked up to me in the street saying I was the right man to drive it forward Cook added that he felt the decision to end Pietersens England career should have been handled better and that he did not want the saga to define his captaincy I was part of the decisionmaking process but I dont have the power or didnt have the power to decide who played for England I was just asked my opinion about it he said However I felt at one time I was a bit of a lightning rod for it That was a hard six months I wouldnt want my captaincy to be talked about just because of that I dont think its fair on myself or on the teams Former England spinner Monty Panesar on BBC Radio 5 live Cook has plenty of years left in him and plenty of scoring to do so I would like to say keep going keep scoring the runs because he is a run machine He is definitely one of the best captains England has ever produced When the pressure is on he has the ability to stay calm He is probably the toughest cricketer England have ever produced and probably the most mentally tough Former England seamer Matthew Hoggard I dont think there will be any issues with Cook playing under a new captain Cook and Root are good friends and they get on well Without the burden of having to do

Partner Sam Bardell age 22 An engineer on 24000 a year plus overtime Location Havant Hampshire House price 182200 for a twobedroom terraced house Deposit 18220 10 with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property It was a case of living at home I moved back into the box room of my mums house and I hated it Sam lived with his parents too so we thought if we can lets do it so we decided to save and go for it We were looking at renting but to us it was like throwing away money How did you do it Being quite tight is probably the answer When we decided we were going to buy I thought Im not going to spend money elsewhere when I dont need to We did still have a nice holiday to Greece I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn 55000 overall which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage Did you make any sacrifices We may have not had such a big social life We still did things but we were conscious What I did was save what I knew I needed to save and lived on whatever I had left which was usually about 200 a month I wasnt buying lunch at work which would save about 25 a week How does it feel to be a home owner It was weird at first When we got the keys it was like are we on holiday When things started to come together it felt like such an achievement Everything we had chosen not to do not going to the cinema one night helped towards it What if you need to move We would be open to the idea but we would probably look for work closer to where we bought a house so it probably would affect future decisions If we did decide we wanted to go somewhere else we would probably look to sell the house and hopefully we will have made some money on it Reaction from friends Its been quite positive I have got friends that have bought houses but a lot of them have had big lump sums of money given to them Should more young people be able to buy a home Neither of us completed three years at university so we probably established a career path earlier than those that do go I speak to a lot of people that have graduated and they cannot find jobs that will allow them to borrow enough It takes years to save a deposit and then house prices go up and they cant borrow enough I think this is how it is now You might also like Name Andrew Douglas age 23 A social worker on 31000 a year Lives with Partner Kirsty Lamb age 24 A pharmacist on 35000 a year Location Moredun Edinburgh House price 145000 for a twostorey terraced house with two bedrooms Deposit 21750 15 with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property We decided we wanted to get on the property ladder as quickly as possible If we get on it now we would be able to buy what we want by the time we are older and looking to have a family How did you do it We started saving at the beginning of 2015 and were probably saving between 400 and 500 a month each We did go on a couple of holidays so although weve been saving weve still been living We werent scrimping but we do only spend about 30 a week on food We check receipts and look for the best deals so that is more thrifty than most people Did you make any sacrifices We spoke about going away for three weeks to somewhere like Australia but we thought its going to cost 2000 each and we can put that towards the house now rather than waiting a few extra months How does it feel to be a home owner It feels strange It does feel like quite a lot of responsibility I didnt realise how much Things like taking out mortgage protection Our friends call it adulting hard Theyre renting and not really thinking about owning a place and theyre like wow youve bought a house Reaction from friends Lots of people think its really good other people say theyre nowhere near that stage I dont know if theyre thinking Im growing up too fast Its generally been positive I dont know anyone who has done it without a partner so I think it would be difficult to do it on your own What if you need to move With a big move we might give it a trial and rent out this house while we lived somewhere else Should more young people be able to buy a home I do think people complain they cant afford to buy a house but they go out every weekend they smoke or they eat out all the time But property prices have also shot up in the last 20 years with more people buying second homes There are also people who dont want to have the responsibility I think its good that the government is helping with Help to Buy schemes and it needs to do more to help firsttime buyers Name Rebecca Thompson aged 23 An information analyst on 21900 a year Lives with Adam Drinkwater aged 25 A bank administrator on 16500 a year Location Irlam Greater Manchester House price 126500 for a threebedroom semidetached house Deposit 6300 5 with the Help to Buy mortgage scheme and Isa Why buy a property We lived in a rental flat together for 18 months and realised that the amount we were paying in rent was more or less the same as we would be paying with a mortgage When we were renting there were a lot of things we couldnt do like decorate or move anything around How did you do it It was difficult I was working parttime in my final year at university so I saved my entire wage and lived off my student loan which wasnt much We didnt go on holiday that year and saved as much as we could Did you make any sacrifices We came straight from university where youre living on a bit of a shoestring anyway so we probably sacrificed but not realised because weve not been enjoying the extra income weve had since graduating We would have probably gone on some more holidays or gone out more and probably bought a few more clothes How does it feel to be a home owner Its brilliant I feel its a really secure base while Im going on to develop my career Its one less thing A lot of people are aiming towards saving a deposit while Ive got past it What if you need to move It would be really difficult and its definitely an attraction for staying where I am In my career there are a lot of opportunities down south but I wouldnt want to entertain it because of the house prices It would take us five times longer to save up a deposit and the amount of income you need to get for a mortgage is totally unobtainable for the average graduate Reaction from friends Some live in a more expensive area and I think they were surprised Its not something thats on a lot of peoples radar owning a home at this age Particularly if youre not in a relationship I dont think it is affordable Should more young people be able to buy a home I think cultures have changed a bit When my parents were growing up their parents drilled into them sort yourself a house get married and thats when your life begins Now theres not as much of an emphasis I think homes do need to be more affordable Its silly that the town where we live in a lot people can afford to buy whereas only as far south as Birmingham noone can afford to buy a house earning what we do Source ONS Department for

questionable outfitsThis years Oscars class photo has been released and as usual there are several quirks and questionable outfits The picture sees 163 of this years nominees gathered together and smiling away but zoom in and there is a whole lot more going on Here are just seven of the things we spotted in this years photo 1 Pharrell Williams didnt exactly dress for the occasion All of this years male nominees are dressed smartly in tuxes and suits Well almost all The dress code memo must have gone into Pharrells junk email inbox because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater To be fair the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures Pharrell wrote several songs for the soundtrack to the film which tells the story of three AfricanAmerican women who worked behind the scenes at the space agency in the 1960s 2 Michelle Williams is upstaged by Casey Afflecks facial hair Casey Afflecks facial hair is fast becoming the eighth wonder of the world It gets longer with every awards ceremony he appears at this season Its now on the verge of totally eclipsing poor Michelle Williams Afflecks costar in Manchester by the Sea who has to peep out from behind his mane She must be used to Affleck stealing her limelight The actor appears in nearly every scene in the 137minute movie while Williamss screen time clocks in at 11 minutes 3 The writer of Moonlight wants you to know how many nominations it has Tarell Alvin McCraney brightens up the back row of the photograph with his winning smile Hes the man behind the stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue which went on to become Moonlight one of this years most hotlytipped Oscars contenders McCraney is so pleased with the films success he wants to let you know just how many Oscar nominations the film has received and he is seen here holding up eight fingers There is of course another explanation He could be making the 305 hand gesture which is the area code for MiamiDade county his home and the place where Moonlight is set Also hats off to Shawn Levy whos standing next to Tarell who wins the award for the most delightfully bright smile of the whole photo He is the producer of Arrival which is nominated for best picture 4 Justin Timberlake needs to sack his tailor Whats your inside leg measurement Justin I dont know maybe 32 inches Hmmm I dont have enough material for that Have a 28inch pair of trousers instead Great thatll do thanks Derek 5 The front row is so where we wanna be Emma Stone Matt Damon Natalie Portman Octavia Spencer are all sitting together in the front row Can someone please organise for us to join this BFF group thatd be great thanks Extra respect for Octavia Spencer for wearing a pair of white trousers while so many of the other female nominees are in a dress or skirt and for Natalie Portman who manages to create the illusion shes impressively wearing high heels even while pregnant with twins She is actually wearing her flat shoes and tipping her heels up Crafty Also Manchester by the Sea producer Kimberly Steward far right is that sweet kid in your class who was accidentally never looking at the camera in the school photo every single year 6 Ryan Gosling needs to cheer up Youre the lead actor in the jointly mostnominated film of all time pal Uncross your arms for goodness sake Slightly happier to be there is the lovely Dev Patel in the row in front looking every inch the Hollywood star Hes come a long way from how he looked at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 when he was starring in Slumdog Millionaire He told the BBC I first came to Toronto in my school shoes and I had a blazer and I was with Frida Pinto his costar and they said You cant put this guy next to her because he looks so terrible I think I got a free penguin suit that didnt quite fit me and they gave me shoes This year hes nominated for best supporting actor and is seen wearing a burgundy Valentino suit Nice 7 Is this gap for Meryl Streep Missing nominees from the photo include Michael Shannon nominated for best supporting actor for Nocturnal Animals and Andrew Garfield best actor Hacksaw Ridge But of course the most notable absentee is Her Royal Acting Highness Meryl Streep who is up for best actress this year for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins Maybe this gap in the back row behind Denzel Washington was intended for her and she got held up in traffic Alternatively perhaps shes been to so many of these things shes just had enough Either way were pretty sure shell be at the ceremony This

113,2017/2/7,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38842791,Use talk not tech to tame your childrens online habits,Like many parents I am the unofficial IT manager in my house And like many IT managers my users are never happy with the service they getLike many parents I am the unofficial IT manager in my house And like many IT managers my users are never happy with the service they get The complaints have got louder over the past few months as I have tried to manage how much time two of them my teenage children spend online and to restrict what they see A patchwork of different technologies help me do this It includes It works after a fashion but I know it has holes and that is why I also use a lot of sneakernet This involves me walking around the house kicking my kids off the game console tablet phone or TV delete as appropriate they are using when they should be doing homework cleaning out the rabbit or getting ready for school Research suggests Im not alone in using tech to oversee online time both to limit it and to help them stay safe About 44 of parents use apps to oversee online activity 39 check browser histories and 37 put controls on the router suggests statistics gathered by security company Symantec I use all three of those and want to use more And it looked like technology was going to get even more useful as electronics companies released products with comprehensive parental controls onboard Its perhaps no surprise that parents are keen to turn to technology to help manage time online says Nick Shaw European general manager at security company Norton because its one area where they struggle to find help When people have a parenting problem with their children they might go to their own parents for advice he says but this is the one area where your parents are not as clued up as you are And he says children are even more clued up and easily capable of running rings around their parents A lot of parents are very naive about this he says Even I got complacent because none of the tech I had put in place was sending me alerts I thought it was all working fine and my children were browsing and gaming in an impenetrable bubble of safety Wrong Slowly I found out that by fiddling with system clocks using safe mode and putting home PCs into sleep states my two teenagers could avoid most of the locks and blocks My schoolboy error says Mr Shaw was to let the hardware do the heavy lifting Technology is going to help you he says but its not going to get away from the fact that you should be having more conversations about this with your kids What I should be doing he says is helping them to understand why the controls are needed Explaining the reasons he says can help to defuse some of the objections It is fair to say that my children and I have had some of these conversations But they have been more of the playlessgamesanddomoremaths type rather than the antivirusstopsyourYouTubeaccountbeingstolen sort Tony Anscombe security evangelist at antivirus company Avast says talking to children about safe ways to use the web is better than just imposing restrictions Sure he says set some rules about how they should use it but you should also educate your kids about basic security principles A lot of parents just do not have the conversation talking to them about what is acceptable and what is not This should cover not sharing passwords and thinking before they share personal data such as contact information images and videos Naivety puts many children at risk he says and it is worth reminding them about what can be done with that information and who might want it It might not just fall into the hands of cyberthieves he says it might also expose them to cyberbullying or just be inappropriate to share Warnings about the hidden features in popular apps are worth passing on he says as they often seek to scoop up more information than they really need The biggest and most important thing that parents can do is run the apps their children do he says This will help parents understand what information children might share and uncover any hidden features the apps possess Some he says look innocuous but are designed to help children conceal what they are doing Gadgets are only half the story if that says Dr Sonia Livingstone from the London School of Economics who studies how children use the internet as part of her work with the longrunning EU Kids Online project Companies should concentrate on doing less selling and more on designing services that do not need the protections they peddle she says In addition she says parents should encourage children to do the right thing by doing it themselves rather than just by dictating terms Its about respect too she says helping children make good decisions instead of arbitrarily imposing rules If they can see the benefits of the rules they are more likely to follow them I am not very keen on the idea that parents have lots of control over their children she says Children have rights too

brand for 30odd years I still really believe in it Its got massive amounts of potential she says Starting any kind of enterprise is challenging with many businesses failing within their first few years and relaunching one can be just as hard Reviving a brand thats been silent for a number of years is very difficult indeed says consultant and author Peter York So whats the best way to go about it Heritage is one factor that certainly seems to be on Mrs Ettedguis side Look at the websites of many luxury names and it is clear that history and tradition are some of the factors that brands are most keen to stress These are attributes that Connolly has in abundance The firm which was familyrun for much of its history began producing leather in the late 19th Century It soon won favour with a huge range of clients Its leather could be found on the seats of many luxury car marques including RollsRoyce at the Houses of Parliament on ocean liners such as the Queen Mary and on supersonic plane Concorde You havent lived until you have sat your naked butt on Connolly leather actress Joan Collins is reported to have said In the 1920s the company asked W Heath Robinson to produce some illustrations to mark its 50th anniversary The artist wellknown for his drawings of outlandish devices was astonished by what he found at the factory in Wimbledon I cant improve on that Mr Connolly was his response to one of the firms remarkable leathermeasuring machines Decades later after doing some corporate identity work for the firm Ms Ettedgui helped the enterprise with a move into retail I just thought this is fantastic�they dont realise what theyve got she remembers The first store opened in 1995 in a mews close to the Lanesborough Hotel in London Several years later Mrs Ettedguis husband Joseph was offered the retail arm of the business because the Connolly family had decided to concentrate on the motor trade Joseph Ettedgui had extensive experience of fashion retailing having built up the Joseph chain of highend fashion stores which had branches across the UK He and Isabel nurtured the retail side of Connolly opening a bigger store in Conduit Street in Mayfair Joseph brought in clothes Mrs Ettedgui recalls It taught me that Connolly wasnt just a brand of briefcases it had potential to be a fashion brand as well But in the 2000s Connolly faltered The familys leather finishing business experienced an unsuccessful expansion into the US And in 2010 Joseph Ettedgui died After Joe died I kept renewing these trademarks and thinking what am I going to do says Mrs Ettedgui She decided to put everything on hold A few years later she began to get the enterprise going once more She licensed Jonathan Connolly a fourth generation member of the family to start producing leather again while she began to look for a suitable retail location Her search led her to a Georgian house just off Londons Savile Row It was a little freehold building which is really rare and I decided to sell my flat put everything I could into it and try and launch it without any external backers she says The house includes several floors of retail space plus an apartment where Mrs Ettedgui now lives For her this is an essential part of the story Theres a desperate need for a different narrative in luxury she says Too many brands are being run in silos by men in suits what people actually like is to see the owner Its like when you go to a restaurant and the chef appears its such a joy you feel connected As well as emphasising a personal touch Mrs Ettedgui has broadened the range of items on sale In addition to leather goods and clothes there will be furniture too Beautiful objects beautiful clothes welldesigned pieces of furniture it just goes together she says Reviving a brand as Mrs Ettedgui is attempting to do is a tricky thing to pull off The things to think about are how to explain what happened because people are suspicious of a relaunch You need to say very clearly what it is youre about and reconcile that with the previous back story says Mr York Mrs Ettedgui is conscious of the challenges she faces but she is cautiously optimistic After a hectic period of building and renovation and working around the clock to get everything ready the store opened in late 2016 Soon afterwards a customer came in and showed Mrs Ettedgui a Connolly wallet that he had bought 20 years ago He was really happy that we were back she says To succeed she believes you need a dream you need an obsession really And you need to believe in something that means you cant not do it

117,2017/2/7,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38733633,NHS Health Check Voices from the NHS frontline,Andrew Foster is the chief executive of Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust It is one of the best performing hospital trusts and up until a year ago it was meeting the fourhour AE target But that began to change in 2016 Instead of hitting the 95 target for patients to be seen and treated or admitted performance dropped to 90 and then 85 in the autumn before it nosedived following Christmas Cubicles in AE were full we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital It started from Boxing Day onwards says Mr Foster We had an outbreak of norovirus which closed three wards and led to 75 staff being off sick Seven care homes had to shut too It meant our performance dropped to around 60 It was the worst three weeks Ive ever known Cubicles in AE were full we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital The whole system backed up Since midJanuary pressures have eased with fourhour performance back above 80 But Mr Foster is still worried The problem we have is that we are seeing more and more patients coming to AE who could be seen by a GP and then we are finding it more difficult to discharge patients There are simply not the places available any more because of the cuts to social care or we are seeing care homes and families themselves saying that the persons care is too complex They end up staying in hospital Simon Walsh is a consultant in an AE department in a major trauma centre in London This year things have been closer to breaking point than Ive ever known it before he says The set of nights I worked in the period before Christmas were the most difficult I remember working in the last 10 years There was just such pressure on the system and as a result the exit block was so sustained that we had patients stuck for hours on end because there werent any beds available to admit them on to wards We had in excess of 20 patients at times for the whole night And it just paralyses the emergency department I dont think Ive ever seen such tired exhausted people they were absolutely dead on their feet He says patients and their families were understanding even though they were frustrated The relatives expressed their frustration but it wasnt anger directed at us they recognised it was factors out of our control But he says morale was low among staff I dont think Ive ever seen such tired exhausted people they were absolutely dead on their feet People try and keep each other up with as high morale as they can but I think people in that period were close to breaking point I wondered if people would actually come back for the next shift after a couple of the nights we did Kimberley Gardner is a nurse at a major trauma centre in the East Midlands working in the critical care department while her partner is also a nurse in the emergency department She says calling the situation in the NHS a humanitarian crisis as the Red Cross did in January is not hyperbole it is the reality It is the worst Ive ever known it I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after vomiting from eating a tin of Quality Street During the coalition years we heard the term black alert being thrown around but it would never actually happen it seemed as likely as a major disaster or terrorist attack devastating but highly unlikely Now its a weekly and sometimes daily occurrence and the novelty has worn off Daily we get a phone call from an emergency department begging critical care for equipment to monitor patients as all of their resus bays have been doubled up where they put two patients in one bay meaning they need two monitors but only have one They ask us but we have run out also She says another issue is not enough trained paramedics or dispatchers for 111 the NHS nonemergency phoneline The amount of people sent in by 111 to be on the safe side its a total failure I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after eating a tin of Quality Street and she was vomiting why would she ring an ambulance but also why did the crew bring her in Because a lot of the time they are technicians and not trained paramedics so bring them in to be on the safe side Julie Orr is the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust She oversees the flow of patients through the hospital managing the site team bed managers and discharge team People dont have time to catch breath before the next onslaught Its been a challenge this winter I think the main difference has been that its been sustained pressure Its been quite relentless rather than periods of a couple of weeks of pressure Ive been in the NHS for 30 years and this is probably one of the most sustained relentlessly pressured winters that Ive seen People dont really have time to catch their breath before the next onslaught of pressures A former nursing manager she says all her team are senior clinicians and move around the site ensuring the flow of patients through the hospital Weve had some very difficult days which has meant that not only the site team but the managers on call and the executive on call have been on site for many many hours into the night to make sure the patients are safe and that the staff are supported But she says her teams have coped remarkably well despite the pressure Obviously its very difficult We all want to do the best for our patients and want to get them home wherever possible or on to the next stage of their journey I think sometimes theres not an understanding of why that cant happen My discharge team along with the ward nursing teams spend a lot of time with patients trying to explain why there might be a delay in that happening Grainne Siggins is director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham Our staff and our staff within the NHS have worked incredibly hard this winter its been really difficult But in December working positively with our colleagues we didnt have any delayed transfers out of hospital at all due to social care She knows from speaking to her local peers within London they are an outlier to be in this situation Because of the boroughs diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues they bring the team has had to proactively plan but she says its becoming increasingly difficult going forward Its difficult to see how the system will be sustained She says they have been heavily supported by their clinical commissioning group Councils are currently prioritising adults and childrens services above other areas of spending but that will only go so far and we do feel we are at a tipping point and thats been borne out this winter its difficult to see how the whole system will be able to be sustained next year And she says the ageing population means assessments are taking much longer People have got much more complex needs multiple long term conditions so weve got that added level of complexity Weve seen a significant increase in the level of support we then have to provide to people to make sure they can go home safely and that they are appropriately supported Dr Olivia Hum has been a GP since 2007 She works in a surgery in Lewes east Sussex The intensity of the work in 2017 is really bad We work 1012 hours a day without a break she says GPs are burning out they are overworked She says the demand on GPs has increased because of the pressure on hospitals AE is too crowded which means that people are not diagnosed properly and they come to the GP for the rest of their health problems They then bounce back to the hospital The local hospital has seen a huge decline in funding so people are on six to ninemonth waiting lists This has a huge impact on GPs who are dealing with the deteriorating symptoms of people waiting for tests or treatment including patients who have symptoms of cancer This waiting also has huge personal impact on patients it increases their worry and stress She adds There is a real crisis in GP staffing Lots of practices are closing so patients try to register at the practice next door which has no space GPs are burning out they are overworked and many are retiring early The system is unsustainable now It is just impossible to provide extra appointments in practices I know GPs with almost twice as many patients as I have and they can only provide care at a very basic level It is not safe the brain cant make these decisions properly in less than 10 minutes In these cases quality of care and patient safety is compromised A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its

in accident and emergency units among other challengesThe NHS has come under intense pressure this winter with record numbers of patients facing long waits in accident and emergency units among other challenges We asked some of those who have fallen ill and the families of others to share their experiences of winter 201617 My dads mental health has really deteriorated I blame the trauma of the fall and the time hes been forced to spend in hospital Sues fathers life changed dramatically after he fell out of bed while in hospital in December 2016 Bryan 84 had been admitted to hospital near their house in Cornwall for a hip operation Sue says she was not told about his fall for several days eventually she was told he would not walk again and possibly had only six months left to live I am devastated six weeks ago everything was fine now this is not the world I imagined Id be in In December he was walking into town doing gardening he loved mechanics and tinkering Now in hospital his mental health has really deteriorated he does not speak and strips naked in public I blame the trauma of the fall and the time hes been forced to spend in hospital Im really on edge I feel like Im about to fall off a cliff I break down in tears at least once a day Hes had his life taken away too soon Are we saying that because hes too complicated our society cant care for him It seems like such a big fight to just find out from the hospital what is going on I just hope to God that he doesnt understand what is happening to him I feel like hell never come home again he seems lost to us I was driving when I realised I was having a heart attack it felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest John Perrins was on the M6 motorway driving home from Cambridge when he realised he was having a heart attack An ambulance driver himself he had feared he would never see his wife again so intense was the pain But a paramedic saved his life at the side of the road I was vomiting and felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest My wife called an ambulance which arrived within 10 minutes seeing the blue lights was the most wonderful thing Ive ever seen I passed out but apparently they performed three lots of heart massage 90 compressions When I came round they spoke to me and although I was scared the way that the paramedic spoke to me made me feel safe The ambulance crew were absolutely phenomenal A friend who is a paramedic came to see me and he told me that the last six heart attack patients he worked on had died I felt so lucky that I had this particular ambulance crew They have given me my life back The paramedic was treating me teaching a trainee and looking after my wife in the ambulance I could not have asked for a better person I am trying to find out the names of the ambulance crew I want to find them so I can say thank you Trevor DallimoreWright says his local GP and hospital are like a family to him regularly providing lifesaving care for his complex health conditions The NHS has been absolutely brilliant says Trevor from London who has diabetes and depression My GP keeps me sane and out of hospital I would give her 10 out of 10 Ive had emergency admittance twice recently with sepsis I went to AE and was treated very quickly Theyve had a great impact on my life NHS treatment has helped me during the times that I could not get out of bed My GP is extremely kind and patient They are so patientcentred I would put them in the luxury bracket All the hospital staff are extraordinarily friendly They are there despite the infrastructure problems in the NHS and the care could not be better From the moment I walk in I know Im being looked after My only problem is that the NHS wont pay for immunotherapy drugs which are at the front line of treatment but are expensive Thirty sixyearold Nikki Alldis satisfaction levels are at the other end of the spectrum however despite also living London She says she has waited 15 months for a bowel operation which has been twice cancelled When the procedure was scheduled for early January she mentally prepared her young children and rearranged her work But Nikki has twice received a lastminute call telling her there is no bed space She is still waiting Id prepared mentally I planned my whole Christmas around the operation and recovery I prepared frozen dinners for my kids they are seven and 13 and I said a farewell goodbye Then in the morning the nurse called me and said We have no bed for you I was gutted The kids were so confused when they came home and I was still there Ive been waiting for 15 months now its hanging over me I did not believe the second appointment would happen but I packed my bags anyway We didnt even bother to rearrange my husbands work that time if hes not working were not earning so we cant afford these cancellations I put things in place with my work for people to cover me Im still waiting hopefully its third time lucky When 29yearold Paul was feeling suicidal in January the NHS crisis care team in west London gave him 24hour care to keep him safe He has received treatment for bipolar disorder for four years and says his consultant and crisis team are outstanding They helped me in my darkest and most depressive hours says Paul who asked for his surname not to be revealed I came back home after New Year and went back to daytoday life but it kicked off a hefty depression and I was left feeling really low and suicidal My partner called the crisis team and they came to our house three or four times a day They come at 0200 or 0300 they are really responsive I dont feel like they are just doing their jobs they have genuine care for me They take away my medication to make sure I will not overdose and when they visit they make me take the medication Sometimes they just spend time with me They ask how I am what did you eat and sometimes they make me do things like go and buy some milk which I dont always feel able to do I would not be alive without them But one problem I have with NHS mental health care is that they medicate but do not do counselling there is a massive waiting list so now I have to get counselling privately I stayed on a chair beside my mum and slept on the floor she died a week later Before she was diagnosed with cancer my mum could run a marathon says Richard Taylor 55 from Liverpool He was devastated after watching her undignified death last month The local cancer centre did not have the capacity to give her endoflife care After she received the second diagnosis she was sent home and we got caught in a communication loop between three hospitals It was an emotional rollercoaster Eventually I had to take her to AE she could not eat or drink She spent 13 hours on a trolley behind a curtain in a noisy and busy ward I stayed on a chair beside her and slept on the floor she died a week later My gripe is with the lack of communication and the delays in my mums treatment The nursing staff were fantastic but there is only so much they can do they could not give my mum 24hour attention She was a very proud and dignified woman but in the end she was simply scared to be alone It was awful watching someone die in this extremely undignified way If she was an animal they would have put her down she was starving and dehydrated The nurses were lovely and compassionate but they offered me no

182,2017/2/7,http://tass.com/science/929374,Scientists unlock secrets that could breach second law of thermodynamics,An international team of scientists under discovered that entropy can decrease in quantum systemsMOSCOW February 7 TASS The law of nondecrease of entropy in closed systems which is one of the formulations of the second law of thermodynamics can be broken said the press service of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology MIPT An international team of scientists under the guidance of Gordey Lesovik Chief Researcher at MIPTs Laboratory of Quantum Theory of Information and the L D Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences discovered that entropy can decrease in quantum systems The results of the study have been published in the journal Scientific Reports from the Nature publishing group We have discovered Maxwells demon which can reduce the entropy in the system Lesovik said Maxwells demon is a mythic creature invented by British physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the second half of the 19th century in order to explain the paradox of the second law of thermodynamics The demon should increase the orderliness of a system which by itself cannot grow in the isolated system according to the laws of physics In the 1870s Ludwig Boltzmann formulated the principle of growth of entropy disorder in his Htheorem which postulated that the value of entropy in a closed system can only increase or remain constant For a long time this theorem could not be proven in the framework of traditional statistical physics without additional restrictions After establishing quantum mechanics scientists suggested that the Htheorem was rooted in the quantum world In the quantum theory of information the important results were obtained which describe conditions when the entropy of a system does not diminishThe group led by Lesovik first formulated the Htheorem in the language of quantum physics and for several years had tried to find proof of that theorem As a result the researchers uncovered conditions when the second law of thermodynamics can be locally breached This can happen in quantum systems of relatively small but macroscopic size measuring a few centimeters or even meters The notable difference between the classical and quantum approach is that in classical physics the decrease of entropy is connected to the transmission of heat energy while in the quantum world the reduction of entropy can take place without energy transfer but due to quantum entanglement According to Lesovik the researchers are planning to perform experiments in the near future to verify the effect Such experiments will open the door to creating a new type of quantum coolers and power generators

saying We have substantially coinciding stances with Tehran Bashar alAssads regime is legitimate and should be preserved while Syrias future must be determined by the people of the country As for Iran Trump currently has other priorities or just does not have enough hard facts the diplomat stressed The Wall Street Journal earlier reported citing highranking sources in the White House Europe and some Arab countries that the Trump administration is searching for ways of destroying the military and diplomatic alliance between Russia and Iran to accelerate the end of the conflict in Syria and step up the fight against the Islamic State terrorist group outlawed in Russia The US will be unable to influence the RussiaIran alliance directly according to Vladimir Yevseyev Deputy Director of the CIS Countries Institute In his view Washington can create problems indirectly primarily by hampering the work of Russian businesses in Iran through new sanctions against Tehran or strengthening the existing ones Discord in the RussiaTurkeyIran troika in Syria is possible as well and Moscow should prevent this from happening the expert went on to say The possible weak points are demands for Tehran to stop arms supplies to Hezbollah via Syria and the withdrawal of Revolutionary Guards advisers from that country If that happens Irans role in Syria will diminish substantially which make combat operations more difficult while Iran will get the impression that it has been excluded from the process In that case it may turn against Russia Moscow and Tbilisi will hold another round of consultations on mending bilateral relations in Prague on Tuesday As usual Russia is represented at the talks by Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin and Georgia by Special Representative for Relations with Russia Zurab Abashidze Georgia has been doing its utmost in terms of abolishing visas for Russians and citizens of other countries Abashidze told Nezavisimaya Gazeta We have cancelled visa restrictions for Russian nationals he said They may stay in Georgia without visas for up to a year For its part Russia simplified visa requirements for Georgian citizens which affected the number of issued visas We heard the Russian presidents remarks about the possibility of abolishing visas If Russia pushes ahead with its efforts in terms of simplifying requirements or abolishing visas we will see that as a step in the right decision which would be praised The visa issue is Russias domain If there are new proposals on this matter we will hear them out and discuss them When asked about the prospects for restoring diplomatic relations between Moscow and Tbilisi Abashidze emphasized that that the issue will not be on the agenda as long as Georgias territorial integrity is violated However if the process of resolving the problems related to Abkhazia and South Ossetia begins if significant progress is made restoration of diplomatic relations could be included in the agenda at some point he emphasized Russias Federal National Guard Troops Service will monitor rallies concerts and football matches by using airships Izvestia writes These highaltitude reconnaissance devices equipped with cuttingedge optics will be able to pinpoint specific pockets of unrest especially rabblerousers and isolate them without endangering other peoples lives and wellbeing They could be used for the first time during the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup scheduled to be held in Russia this summer A source in the Russian National Guard informed TASS that the use of aerial monitoring systems is a new direction in developing weapons for Russias National Guard Troops As a rule there is a small group of troublemakers who revel in sparking destructive activity They are behind the masses of people who take to the streets Sergey Melikov First Deputy Director of the Russian National Guard explained in an interview with the paper Therefore we need to localize such offenders and detain the instigators We ensure peoples safety first and foremost We see our mission as preventing adverse conditions where mass discontent may escalate into mass civil disobedience Meanwhile Vsevolod Alexeyev Chairman of the Society for Consumer Rights Protection in Sports told the paper that the proposed move could be of considerable help in ensuring security during the Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup It is clear that security requirements during the World Cup and the Confederations Cup in Russia will be very stringent and the task of all services involved is to minimize possible incidents If aerial monitoring makes it possible to identify specific individuals who break the law this will significantly contribute to ensuring security Moldovas President Igor Dodon will soon start negotiations with other representatives of the Moldovan authorities on Transnistria and the presence of Russian peacekeepers there presidential adviser for Transnistria Vasile Sova informed Nezavisimaya Gazeta Prime Minister Pavel Filip earlier asked the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE to again consider the issue of the illegal presence of Russian troops including peacekeepers in Moldova According to Sova Russian peacekeepers were deployed to that country under the 1992 agreement which has a substantial legal base which means that there are no grounds to question their presence However they could be replaced as part of the 52 international negotiation framework Moldova and Transnistria as parties Russia Ukraine and the OSCE as mediators and EU and the US as observers Negotiations within this framework were frozen for several years After the arrival of President Igor Dodon a glimmer of hope appeared that they could be revived Dodon was the first president who travelled to Tiraspol to meet with new Transnistria leader Vadim Krasnoselsky and struck a deal on regular meetings with him the paper notes The ruling coalition in Moldova never achieved any positive results during its negotiations with Transnistria Irina Vlah head of Moldovas Gagauz autonomy told the paper But then Dodon appeared who is prepared for talks with Transnistria at any level Dialogue is necessary but there is no need to hurry she said The latest wave of arrests in Turkey is not only part of a counterterrorism campaign but also part of the preparations for the referendum on a new draft Constitution which envisages transitioning the country from a parliamentary to a presidential republic a source close to diplomatic circles in Ankara told IzvestiaThe vote is expected to be held in April the source said Meanwhile Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan needs to tackle two problems namely the economic crisis and rampant terrorism This will make it possible for him to get the required support from the Turkish population So the recent arrests should be seen from this perspective as well According to the latest data Turkish security forces have arrested nearly 800 people suspected of having links to the Islamic State terrorist group outlawed in Russia Igor Morozov member of Russias Federation Council upper house of parliament International Affairs Committee said in an interview with the paper that this is further evidence of Ankaras change in attitude towards those forces which the Turkish leadership previously had turned a blind eye to Turkeys stance on the Islamic State has changed significantly Erdogan saw that members of this group carry out terrorist attacks against Turkish officials Very often militants are a tool in the hands of the opponents of the Turkish president Morozov explained The senator added that the largescale arrests can be seen negatively in Turkish society too since many of Erdogans political opponents have been detained as well TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in thepress reviews

to state wealth fund,Turkey has transfered government stakes worth billions to a new sovereign wealth fund The fund could be used to finance mega projects to revive the economy but would lead to greater political control of companiesTurkey has transferred government stakes worth billions of dollars in its flag carrier Turkish Airlines the countrys largest bank by assets Ziraat Bank and fixedline operator Turk Telekom to a sovereign wealth fund SWF Some analysts told DW that ahead of the planned presidential referendum which would allow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to consolidate his power this move would lead to greater political control of the companies but without the necessary oversight Analysts also said that the newly transferred assets could be used as collateral to secure funding for major infrastructure projects Political control The move is likely to increase political control over the companies now owned by the SWF said Wolfango Piccoli director of research at advisory firm Teneo Intelligence The transfer of state assets to the SWF comeses at a time of increasing political involvement in the economy he said Piccoli said that over the last 18 months more than 600 privatelyowned companies have been seized by the government on suspicion of links with theexiled Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen who Erdogan blames for orchestrating the failed July 15 coup attempt last year More than 600 privatelyowned companies have been seized by the government over the last 18 months In the third quarter the economy shrank for the first time in almost seven years while investors worry that the structural reform agenda would stall due to Erdogans ambition to boost the economy ahead of the presidential referendum The creation of the wealth fund will in all probability allow Erdogan and his team to exercise greater control over companies in which the state already owns large stakes but without the level of transparency demanded by members of Turkeys political opposition especially the CHP Anthony Skinner director of the Middle East and North Africa practice at Verisk Maplecroft told DW Mega Projects The Erdogan government in 2013 announced 200 billion dollars worth of infrastructure investments as part of its 2023 goals Building a waterway and the worlds largest airport in Istanbul were among these goals as Erdogan has been relying on large scale projects to bolster the construction industry and boost domestic demand The economy has slowed following the coup attempt and analysts said that President Erdogan aims to revive the stalling economy with mega projects The creation of the fund confirms the governments goal to drive large infrastructure projects forward to boost economic growth over the coming years Infrastructure megaprojects and the governments diplomatic offensive to expand exports are intended to help offset the impact of reduced domestic consumption and demand in 2017 Verisk Maplecrofts Skinner said In recent months Erdogan has applied intense pressure to commercial banks to increase loans to the private sector in an attempt to boost flagging economic growth Erdogan has also been pressuring the central bank for some time to lower interest rates to support economic growth The country has been hit by rising regional tensions political uncertainties amid widening concern about the crackdown following the failed coup which also battered its currency The government is currently struggling to finance a series of highprofile infrastructure projects Erdogan hopes these will boost his domestic prestige and enable him to consolidate his grip on power through the introduction of an executive presidential system with almost no checks or balances said Piccoli The Yavuz Sultam Selim bridge which spans the banks of the Bosphorus was opened in August 2016 Fiscal discipline Some are concerned about the motive of the decision despite the claims by the government that the fund will not compromise fiscal discipline I think there are several reasons for concern One is that it suggests that Turkey is unlikely to privatize key companies in which the state has an interest providing further evidence that the reform agenda is unlikely to restart Another reason is that it could provide scope for a significant loosening of fiscal policy Capital Economics economist William Jackson told DW The fund approved by parliament in August is headed by Mehmet Bostan a former banker and head of the privatization administration last year Appointments to the board included Erdogans advisers and aides Sovereign wealth funds are often associated with oil producing countries such as Norway or Gulf states who set aside money from energy exports for investment Norways 890billion 832 billion euros sovereign wealth fund is the worlds largest One final point I would make is that we tend to think of wealth funds such as those in the Gulf having significant foreign currency assets ultimately those can be sold to improve the balance of payments position But Turkeys wealth fund would hold lira assets so it couldnt be used in the event of another balance of payments shock Jackson said Opposition politicians expressed concerned about the move Opposition party CHP lawmaker and former treasury undersecretary Faik Oztrak told a press conference that this government set up a wealth fund to pledge

crisis,The Lake Chad Basin crisis is now at a turning point Boko Harams attacks and military counteroffensives have displaced at least 23 million peopleThe Lake Chad Basin is grappling with a humanitarian emergency affecting some 17 million people across northeastern Nigeria northernCameroon western Chad and Niger Many of those affected have had to flee their homes The majority of the displaced are sheltered by communities who are themselves among the worlds most vulnerable The Lake Chad Basin crisis was until recently one ofthe fastest growing refugeecrises in Africa and it is becoming the most acute food and nutritional crisis in Africa It is the fourth biggest humanitarian response for United Nations UN and nongovernmental organisationsin 2017 Toby Lanzer the assistant SecretaryGeneral to the UN spoke to DW ahead of the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region at the end of February DW How is the humanitarian situation in the Lake Chad region Toby Lanzer The situation continues to be very grave I think over the past few months we have understood more fully what is happening thanks to an improved security situation which has enabled the United Nations and its partners to travel further afield from the main town Maiduguri and get a stronger appreciation from the people themselves who have been stuck in many villages and towns But we know that there are millions of people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance and we are doing our utmost together with the international community to meet the needs Lanzer says the displaced often end up in vulnerable regions Has the response fromforeign governments been adequate Well adequate is a difficult word to use And I think there are so many crises in different parts of the world I think that via DW and others we are hoping to get the word out That there is a particularly grave crisis the numbers are huge 10 million in need 7 million who are severely food insecure and 515000 children who are acutely malnourished I dont think any single government on earth in the world could face that alone International solidarity is required And that is required at a time when pressures are high all over the globe and so no the response is inadequate at the moment but am hopeful that in coming weeks more countries will come on board and help the UN and NGOsto work with the communities and the authorities of Cameroon Chad Niger and of course of Nigeria to meet the needs What support do you want from the German government I think Germany has really come on board as a very strong supporter in political terms and the chancellor herself has been to Niger one of the key countries in this region I think that political support usually signals financial support which I understand will be on its way And at the end of the day thats actually what people need because the money will be translated into medicines food shelter and all the other things that people who are in desperate need require on a day to day basis to weather this terrible storm thats afflicted them What is your wish as far as the donors conference is concerned There will be a conference thanks to Germany Nigeria and Norway and with support of the UN the international community will gather in Oslo Norway on the February 24 I think my wish there is really a stronger recognition by a broader range of countries including Canada the Netherlands and Korea Lets say a broader range of countries who recognize the gravity of the situation and the scale of the need and that that they actually join the effort of countries such as Germany the United Kingdom the United States and theEuropean Commission and the UN in meeting peoples various serious need to survive this violenceperpetrated by Boko Haram which comes on top of abject poverty climate change and real challenges which have wrecked peoples lives and made it so very difficult for them What could the governments of the countries located in the Lake Chad region do We are hopeful that whether its Cameroon Chad Niger or Nigeriathey will continue to do what they have been which is to do that utmost to care for their own people But there are limits to what poor countries can do And you know on that note so many people look at me and say isnt Nigeria a rich country Well it is and it is not At the moment oil production has plummetedOil prices are low so its a very trying moment for Nigeria to do everything that it would like to for its ownpeople But lets congratulate the government of Nigeria and others in the region for having facilitated the work of the aid agencies For having made sure that we feel welcomefor making sure that we are safe This is a difficult part oft the world to be operating in Violent extremists are not particularly easy by any means when it comes to the populations of the region but also aid agencies So the governments really have been very forthcoming trying to do as much as they possibly can but also welcoming the international communities support in this time of severe crisis Toby Lanzer is the assistantSecretary General tothe United Nations and Regional Humanitarian

disinformation campaign,Germanys secret services have found little evidence that the Kremlin is directly trying to manipulate the countrys public opinion But the leaked government report suggests that indirect methods may be at workRussian President Vladimir Putin is not deliberately trying to undermine Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of her impending reelection campaign or at least if he is he is hiding his tracks well Thats the inconclusive conclusion that Germanys foreign and domestic intelligence agencies came to last fall following several months of investigation which was delivered to Merkels chiefofstaff Peter Altmaier in the form of a 50page report Altmaier chose not to make the report public but it was leaked to the S��ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper this week According to the paper the BND Germanys equivalent of the CIA and its domestic counterpart the Verfassungsschutz BfV was charting a middle way between two conclusions firstly that the Russian government is not directly spreading misinformation in Germany and secondly that it is but it couldnt be proven An opendirect control or financing through Russian state authorities or Russian intelligence agencies could not be proven in any cases the report said Nevertheless such activities could be carried out by people and organizations outside the services Though these various external protagonists were not playing a prominent role in endangering Germanys security interests further investigative efforts were still necessary the intelligence agents added Merkel commissioned the report into Russian intervention Threads to the Kremlin Despite not being able to find any direct evidence the German spies seemed convinced that the Russian government is coordinating a campaign to sow disunity in the EU and Germany and so to weaken their position of power from the highest levels of the Russian government The bundling of all the influencing activities in the presidential administration does represent a significant success factor The report listed three wellpublicized examples of how Russian actors may have spread misinformation in Germany or at least about Germany The first was the case of Lisa a 13yearold RussianGerman living in Berlin who told police in January 2016 that she had been raped by people of Mediterranean appearance Though she later admitted to having made the story up the case made international headlines and sparked protests outside Merkels office by both farright groups and the Russian community in Berlin The situation escalated when Russian state media and the Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the German police of covering up the crime The news that she disappeared was kept secret for a very long time Lavrov told a press conference The newlyleaked German intelligence report also noted a Russianlanguage WhatsApp message that was widely distributed among Russianspeaking Germans last winter which read Muslims organizing a sexjihad in Europe on February 14 This was part of a conspiracy theory alleging that a Muslim hate preacher had called on his followers to massrape German women on that date Since the message was deemed amateurish the German intelligence agencies concluded there was no involvement from Russian secret services Meanwhile in other cases the German chancellery decided that the agencys conclusions were too speculative one of the reasons it was not made public No clear agenda Mark Galeotti Russian security specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations said this lack of clarity was nothing new Theres no question that Russia is supporting and sponsoring a campaign to use disinformation to try and have a political impact he told DW The issue isnt Is there a fake news campaign Yes of course there is The issue is Is all fake news Russian The answer is clearly not Altmaier said much of the evidence was inconclusive There is evidence of the Kremlins involvement but there isnt evidence of how effective it is Galeotti said The Kremlin puts a lot of money into its soft power arms like state news outlet RT and we know that the Kremlin lies to a considerable degree for political effect We also know there are attempts to carry out more covert and subversive acts secret funding for political groups that kind of thing Indeed the new German report found possible Russian influence attempts being made on Germanys nationalist Alternative for Germany AfD party Russias alleged hack on the Democratic National Convention in the US last year unsettled many in Germany who wonder whether the Kremlin may be planning a similar attempt to sabotage the Bundestag election in September even if the hacks ultimate effect on the US vote balanced against other factors is impossible to quantify Not only that is toppling Merkel actually Moscows conscious policy Well maybe but theres a certain degree of stability in having Merkel as chancellor and you never know quite what an alternative government would mean pointed out Galeotti Its not like the Russians want to conquer Europe I dont believe that for a minute but what they do want to do is ensure that Europe is too divided to prevent Russia from imposing its will on Ukraine and Belarus and Georgia Furthermore just because Russia has state news outlets doesnt mean they are constantly being controlled by the state I know people who work in the RT

to use better judgement in public statements,To avoid potential future moves to oust him from office President Trump should be more careful in what he says the former chief ethics advisor to President Bush tells DW He also compares the two Republican presidentsDW Donald Trump has handed over the management of his businesses to a trust run by his sons A Trump lawyer also said that the company would not engage in any new foreign deals during Trumps tenure and that new domestic deals would be vetted rigorously by a neutral ethics advisor Whats wrong with that approach Richard Painter The president still owns the businesses which means that all the money that is paid into the businesses is for the financial benefit of the president And the money that comes from foreign governments banks controlled by foreign governments or sovereign wealth funds is in violation of the United States Constitution The Constitution specifically prohibits anyone who holds a position of trust with the United States government including the president from receiving economic benefits from foreign governments So that money from foreign governments and entities controlled by foreign governments is unconstitutional Other money coming into the Trump business empire from private sources creates serious conflicts of interests We are very concerned about the president having investments all over the world in places where there could be all sorts of trouble That is not a good situation for the United States and so we feel strongly that the president needs to divest ownership interest from his businesses The head of Germanys BGA foreign trade association has said new economic alliances are required to offset the expected negative impact from Donald Trumps protectionist agenda and keep German exports strong 07022017 US President Donald Trump has lashed out against a federal judge over legal pushback against his travel ban Though that is disturbing the good news is that the system of checks and balances seems to be working 06022017 A court in San Francisco is to hear the US Justice Departments arguments over whether the entry ban should be restored The order which temporarily bars people from seven Muslimmajority states is currently on hold 07022017 You along with several other prominent lawyers and the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics CREW have sued President Trump under the so called Emoluments Clause which bars high government officials from receiving gifts or money from a foreign state You filed the suit a few days after the inauguration What is the current state of the lawsuit This is one of dozens of lawsuits against the president in his official capacity because the way in which the president has chosen to run his administration and conduct his business Our lawsuit asks the judge to look at the foreign government payments coming into the Trump business empire to look at the Constitution and decide what the president can and what he cannot keep under the Constitution The suit has been filed and the judge shall decide what the procedures going forward shall be and when decisions will be made That is out of our control at this point While many legal experts agree that you may be right on the issue they argue that you dont have the necessary standingto win the case meaning that you are not personally hurt and affected by the case How do you counter that The federal courts in the New York area where we filed the suit have been willing to give standing to organizations such as ours which had to substantially alter their work and their mission and have been affected by the unconstitutional conduct of government officials There is case law in the second circuit court supporting our positions and we hope that the courts do give standing Ultimately the Supreme Court may have to rule on that issue If the courts do not give standing to organizations such as ours then the courts may end up not deciding this constitutional question at all and the alternative would be for the House of Representatives in two or three years to convene a hearing and investigate and find out what foreign government money the president has received and then think about what action to take The problem is that this is a very politicized process and will be for sure if the Democrats ever get control of the House of Representatives It could result in impeachment of the president a constitutional crisis and this is something we believe can be avoided if the courts in a much more neutral manner are willing to give us standing and then decide what the president can keep and what he cannot Former chief White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter Much has been made recently by opponents of the president about the 25th amendment as a possible way to remove Donald Trump from office without impeachment The amendment allows the removal of a president who is deemed unable to discharge the powers and duties of his officetemporarily by a majority vote of the vice president and cabinet but ultimately requires a twothirds vote in Congress Do you consider this as a realistic option at all The 25th amendment is used to deal with a different situation when the president is incapacitated not when he is acting illegally It is designed to deal with a president who is incapacitated due to the presidents physical or mental health At this point all I would say is that President Trump should use better judgment in his public statements Thats where we are right now I dont think the evidence is there at this point to say that the president is not physically or mentally capable of carrying out the duties of the president But I do think he needs to be somewhat more careful and balanced in what he communicates to the public You served as the chief ethics lawyer for President George W Bush Can you briefly compare how President Bush dealt with ethics questions and how President Trump is handling it President Bush insisted that he as president set a good example for everyone working in the administration and that he set the right tone at the top And President Bush like every other president in recent memory made absolutely sure that he had no financial conflicts of interests with his official duty He followed the same rules as everyone in his administration He did not say that he was somehow special because he was president He never would have said that the president does not have a conflict of interest unless the president indeed had taken the steps that he took to make absolutely sure that there was no conflict of interest in fact The president is not above the law and President Bush was adamant about that point Thats one of many respects that President Bush was quite different He also felt very strongly that our country must welcome people of all religions and races President Bush right after 911 made it very clear that the United States was not in a war with Islam and that we welcome Muslims to our country We are certainly at war with extremism of any sort and that that is what the war on terror is about President Bush would never have tolerated any effort to denigrate or discriminate against Muslims in the United States He recognized that that was unAmerican and unconstitutional Richard Painter is a law professor at the University of Minnesota From 2005 to 2007 he served as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W Bush The interview was conducted by Michael Knigge

have failed to put an end to the political crisis in Macedonia Gudrun Steinacker former German ambassador to Macedonia explains what can be done to help the small Balkan countryDW Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov declined to offer a mandate to form a new government to the main opposition party the Social Democrats Previously the conservative leader and former premier Nikola Gruevski had failed to form a government How do you evaluate the presidents role in the current political crisis Gudrun Steinacker I find it deplorable because he does not anwer the question what else there is to do and how to overcome the present situation in the country So the only other solution would probably be new elections which would mean another few months of total stagnation That would be an expensive choice for a small country like Macedonia Organizing elections so often is very difficult Editors note The last vote in December was held as part of a European Unionbrokered deal between Macedonias main political parties aimed at ending a longrunning political crisis At the elections in December Gruevskis conservative party VMRODPMNE secured 51 seats in the 120seat parliament only two more than the Social Democrats The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed the West was trying to destabilize Macedonia The goal is obvious to deal with Macedonian politicians unwelcomeby the West it stated at the end of last week Do you agree with Moscow that conservative leader Gruevski is unwelcome by the West Gudrun Steinacker former German ambassador to Macedonia and Montenegro Of course his reputation is severely damaged due to the wiretapping affair which has not been clarified yet We have to see what the special prosecutor will finally come up with We know how often she is being attacked by media organizations close to theVMRODPMNE which is not acceptable in my view She should have a chance to do her job During my time as an ambassador I did not see that Russia was really playing a constructive andpositive role in Macedonia And Im a little amazed at the relatively new interest of Russia in Macedonia Im not sure whether the Russians are really taking into account that this is a fragile ethnically and religiously very mixed country I have the feeling that the Russian government is either not aware of this or that it doesnt take it into account sufficiently And finally I dont see what Russia is offering the country and the region Many politicians in Brussels and Berlin seem to be tired of the Macedonian crisis Do you see any danger that the EU and Germany who obviously have to deal with much bigger problems such as Trumps presidency the Brexit and the refugee crisis could give up on this small Balkan country and accept any solution that might guarantee its stability even at the expense of democracy It is difficult to predict what is going on in Brussels There is acertain fatigue with regard to the crisis in Macedonia and to the situation in the Balkans particularly regarding EU enlargement That was even an argument used by Western and German politicians in their dialogue with regional elites with the message You have to make more efforts towards reforms I could imagine that there is a certain fatigue but on the other hand I think the crucial people who are dealing with Macedonia are aware that they cannot give up on the country and that they have to stay involved But there are also different positions in different EU countries and I see a problem for the EU to find a common stance on what to doand how to do it Do you think the EU is doing enough in Macedonia and in the Balkans As someone who has been involved with the Balkans for so many years it is my personal view that there is not enough involvement although we do a lot for the Balkans in particular terms economic support support for the reforms etc But perhaps we should rethink the methods and instruments that we the EU or Germany are usingand adapt them more to the problems of the region so that we can see real progress and not only progress onpaper What could be the solution for the Macedonian crisisin your opinion I think we should ask in the foreseeable future for all the claims of wrongdoing and even criminal acts to be investigatedI would not exclude anyone And all those who are under investigation should refrain from taking political positions until we know what actually happened It is still very unclear what happened in many cases I would like to mention for example the case of the young people who were killed in Smilkovci in 2012 These are cases that put a strain on relations between the different ethnic groups in the country Macedonia will only survive as a liberal democratic country a homeland for all its citizens irrespective of their ethnicity or religion Gudrun Steinacker was Germanys ambassador to Macedonia from 2011 to 2014

solidarity upholding human rights directives maintaining access to immigrant laboror financial markets or the fear of the unknown Many Brits feel their country has bitten off more than it can chew by opting to leave the EU A divided Britain Dr Chris Moreh a Research Fellow at the Center for Population Change at the University of Southampton said the vote had brought to surface divisions that had developed during at least the previous decade or so and seemed to have legitimized certain forms of prejudice and hate speech against migrants and judges who were vilified by the rightwing press for ruling that the government could not trigger Article 50 declaring the intention to withdraw from the EU without the authorization of Parliament The UK certainly feels more divided after the Brexit vote and any perception of increased division has real social circumstances Dr Moreh told DW During the public debates on Brexit in the coming years citizens and EU nationals may very well feel that the country is becoming less welcoming less tolerant of differences in opinion and overall more divided Indeed David Isaac chairman of the statefunded Equality and Human Rights Commission told MPs last month that he feared a fresh increase in religiously or racially motivated hate crimeagainst EU citizens in Britain when Article 50 is triggered as was the case in the two months after the vote

century its essential now for all nations to be able to trade freely we all recognize that Greg Mayn fears that Britain will be out of its depth in future trade deals However Greg Mayne a tax consultant who voted to remain was less sure arguing We dont have the expertise to negotiate trade deals we havent done so for 40 yearsDowlen in more apocalyptic language feared that leaving the EU was tantamount to being herded off the economic cliff edge into the abyss Resentment between leavers and remainers could sink back beneath the surface given that the latter have no Nigel Faragelike figurehead to agitate for them But the test of cohesion will be seen in the experience of EU nationals and levels of hate crime over the next months and possibly years

244,2017/2/7,http://www.dw.com/en/don-t-waste-it-eat-it/a-37445177?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf,Dont waste it eat it,Why dont we eat crooked cucumbers and knobbly carrots Because theyre hard to find thats why Initiatives in Germany and the Czech Republic are encouraging consumers to get more daring with their fruit and veggiesWhen it comes to culinary delights our eyes want to feast too and that also impacts our shopping habits When we hit the produce department at the local grocer we always grab the most appealing specimens This aesthetic expectation leads to food waste and makes us oblivious to mother natures diversity Supermarkets and grocery chains only offer fruit and vegetables that look uniform explains Anna Strejcov�� spokeswoman and cofounder of the Czech initiative Zachra�� j��dlo Save the Food Retailers claim that consumers wont buy anything else About 20 percent of crops in the Czech Republic and up to 30 percent in German are kept from our plates as a result of norms that determine the size shape and color of fruit and vegetables But since food doesnt always grow uniformly it has to be sorted says Strejcov�� And this sorting often happens right on the fields during harvest time It wasnt originally a question of aesthetics that led to this idealization of cucumbers apples and the like but the fact that uniformly shaped produce takes up less space when stored and transported Retailers developed internal norms as did the EU with its oftencited bendy cucumber directive But blaming the latter for produce uniformity does not sit well with Amelie Mertin of the German Querfeld initiative What many people dont know the EU bendy cucumber directive has not been in effect since 2009 A flexible leek can become many kinds of dinner It just needs a chance It is a vicious circle Consumers are conditioned to buy straight cucumbers because supermarkets will not stock anything else which in turn does not allow customers to become reaccustomed to different shapes and sizes or perhaps they dont even remember they exist We must educate the public Demand it buy it Amelie Mertin urged She takes this topic very personally As a business student she worked at organic farms during semester breaks and was shocked to hear about the amount of food that goes to waste Many people dont even know how much we throw away In Germany alone roughly 18 million tons of groceries are squandered annually enough to fill 450000 transport trucks Veggies withcharacter Zachra�� j��dlo is also fed up with the fact that we place greater value on appearance than taste A campaign called Jsem pipraven I am ready aims to put to rest the argument that the customer is not prepared to buy nonstandard fruits and vegetables Almost 10000 Czech supporters have joined the cause since its inception Querfeld is a product of the Berlin startup scene and designed to appeal to the public at large Wer not trying to convert anybody or wag our finger at consumers pressuring them to buy our misshapen vegetables Amelie Mertin explained Instead our campaigns aim to get people excited about our produce Communication is key so the campaign must be hip and fun They appeal to the public with vegetables with character like tomatoes with noses and the huge variety of root vegetables When we make it fun we reach a large audience says the young woman who started working for Querfelds Munich branch in early 2016 with a fiveheaded eggplant Just a few examples from the Mutato series The Mutato series consists of thousands of pictures this is just a small selection The installation for the World Food Day at the DesignQuartier Ehrenfeld in Cologne 2011 also known as a tomato A collection of different tomato varieties and at the same time the first species of the Cultivar series An old tomato variety from Greeneville Tennessee USA A tomato variety from the IPK gene bank in Gatersleben found by F Schwanitz 1957 A beautiful tomato variety found by friends of the photographer in France Different varieties of the common bean Author Klaus Esterluss Zachra�� j��dlo is also playing with the aesthetics of nonconformity On the Artwall that runs along the bank of Pragues Vltava River activists have placed photographs by German artist Uli Westphalthat depict oddlyshaped fruits and vegetables a theme he has been working on since 2006 Westphals exhibition is supposed to show that misshapen produce is not only delicious but also visually unique We are pleased when the consumer thinks its cool but that cannot be the extent of it Anna Strejcov�� emphasizes That is why we initiated round table discussions and invited farmers distributers experts and representatives from the department of agriculture We want to tell them which concrete steps can be taken to bring otherwise discarded produce to market All about quality Querfeld has already found one solution They deliver to business clients such as catering companies and cafeterias who do not care about the appearance of the cucumber before they chop it up To get to this point Querfeld had to convince producers and retailers to play along And that wasnt always easy Young citydwellers promoting a startup was enough to make farmers a little skeptical It was important that our project was not a oneoff campaign Amelie Mertin points out In the meantime the relationship between Querfeld and producers has grown strong although the fledging food saving business cant always take everything off the farmers hands Too big for the shelves but not for the aspirations of food savers in Germany and the Czech Republic The main priority for both initiatives in Germany and the Czech Republic is to prevent food waste Regardless of appearance the quality of the fruit and vegetables must be high It is important to us that the produce be regional and organic Amelie emphasizes We do not buy and sell old or moldy produce just food that is optically irregular This reduces food waste increases profits for farmers and offers customers an opportunity to get organic produce at great prices This article was written in cooperation with j��du and FUTUREPERFECT with the support of the

southern end of Australias Great Barrier Reef A tour boat sits moored on a thin slice of white sand as snorkelers marvel at coral beneath crystal clear waters But the boats captain Mike Evans says these days some visitors have worries on their minds Ive actually had a few people tell me that theyve come to see the reef before its too late he told DW I tell them that our areas fine but they are having bleaching problems up north Lost treasure Last year there were reports of the largest coral dieoff ever recorded at the Great Barrier Reef The reefs northern region lost 67 percent of its shallowwater corals in 2016 prompting some media to claim the reef was already dead The damage didnt extend as far south as the Whitsunday Islands But tour operators in the coastal town of Airlie Beach where visitors disembark to explore the islands say more and more people are coming to see the reef before it vanishes I heard that because of the global warming there was degradation of coral reefs Sergi Altadill visiting from Barcelona told DW I was thinking this is the moment to come because in a few years there is no more coral reef in this area It isnt just Australias reefs that are under threat In December the United Nations Environment Program published a study showing that with current trends 99 percent of the worlds reefs will suffer severe bleaching annually by the end of this century Bleaching occurs when the water becomes too warm causing coral to expel the algae that gives it its vibrant color The result isnt just a white hue that disappoints divers thecoral is also leftvulnerable to starvation and disease Modeling the reefs future Still behind the UN study was a development that offers some hope It drew on new highresolution projections based on global climate models topredict when and where coral bleaching will occur In conducting her research environmental scientist Karen Joyce enjoys a great overview of marine life in the Great Barrier Reef This photo shows a panoramic view of Heron Island from the west The flattened disklike bodies of two rays are visible in the lower right of the image Joyce sets the flying robot on a preprogrammed mission She operates the drone with a remote control and a computer Photographs taken by the drone can be downloaded after the mission This drone view shows the southern part of the Heron Reef flat and open water out to Wistari Reef The Great Barrier Reef is a collection of different undersea habitats The picture above shows corals and algae on Heron Island from about 20 meters 66 feet up in the air and looks like a piece of art A live feed of what the drone sees will be sent back to Joyces computer albeit in low resolution On the left sharks can be seen swimming in the boat channel on Heron Island On the right hand side dense coral is visible Drone technology offers a great advantage in that it enables Joyce to survey areas that are too difficult or too dangerous to access This also allows scientists to cover a much larger area than snorkeling or scuba diving would With the help of drones scientists are able to get highresolution information with much greater detail than data provided by satellites This image shows a highly detailed mosaic of hundreds of individual photos taken by Joyces drone above Heron Reef The Great Barrier Reef suffers from massive coral bleaching With this phenomenon corals expel symbiotic algae turn white and eventually die Climate changeinduced warming of seawater is regarded as one of the main reasons for coral bleaching Research by scientists like Karen Joyce could shed further light on the mechanisms behind the phenomenon Author Oleg KddingZurm��hlen Roger Beedon director of tourism and stewardship at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority says this opens up new possibilities to use data collected by scientists and tour operators Coral reefs are made up of animals but they behave a bit more like forests because many of them can live for hundreds of years and they can lock up a record of what has happened to them during that period of time he told DW Theyre a bit like trees You can look at growth bands within those corals and you can see how well they were doing each year This information about the pastcan be used to model future developments and combined with currentobservations gathered by tour boatsThathelps focus protection efforts on areas atriskand hasimplications for global conservation efforts One of the important things about reefs is they can give us insights about whats happening at global scale Beedonsays Cruise Whitsundays the largest tour operator in the area has been participating in a monitoring program called Eye on the Reef since 2007 Tour boats survey the sites they visit regularly and provide data to help manage any impacts they find including bleaching Reef outreach Company spokesperson Alyce Carter says the tours also educate visitors about the dangers the reef faces and dispel exaggerated claims of the reefs death Whats missing in media reports is that the degree the reef is affected varies widely from insignificant to severe she told DW Its the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef that is currently experiencing a major coral bleaching event That area is approximately 1590km from our pontoons People who have lived in this area for more than 20 years have observed that the reef around our pontoons is in the best condition they have ever seen Bleaching happens when algae is expelled from coal leaving it vulnerable to starvation and disease Not all locals agree Sandra Williams is a campaigner with the Australian Marine Conservation Society who lives in Airlie Beach Im fortunate enough to have seen the Great Barrier Reef at its most magnificent best she told DW But I also know that people alive now and those coming in the future will never have the opportunity to see what Ive seen on the reef because it is a very different place even now Williams acknowledges that tour operators in the Whitsundays have upped their reef monitoring activity and educate visitors about environmental threats Treading lightly Many of the boats that go out daily are actively engaged in reporting changes they see to scientists and government bodies to build up that picture of what is happening locally in the marine environment she says People are very engaged and proactive in looking after their patch and also in trying to shift government regulation and policy to enact better reef protection But she says this isnt the case with some operators in other parts of the reef They dont want it publicised that the reef is under threat or that theres been coral bleachingbecause they see an immediate negative impact on their business And tour boats themselves pose a threat to the reefboth through engine pollution and by scraping the coral surface Operators likeCruise Whitsundays are part of anecocertification scheme which means they takeprecautions above and beyond what is legally required Tourists board a Whitsundays cruise boat to see southern parts of the reef which have seen only minimal bleaching TheGreat Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority also restricts their movements with a complex system ofpermitting and zoning whichactively engages tour operators in a communication loop The authority uses information their boatsgatherto identify vulnerable areas of the reef and restrict activity there Extreme weather Minimizing damage from tourism is vital given the threatfrom climate change And with extreme weather events happening more frequently thisis not limited to bleaching Right now one of the main concerns forthose protecting the reef is ensuring corals are in the best possible health if and when a cyclone hits Were now in the middle of our summer period this is traditionally our cyclone season says Williams For first time in three years were actually having a wet season and I expect somewhere at least once in the coming months somewhere on the coast there will be a massive cyclone Williams says if a cyclone hit a northern area like Port Douglas where two thirds of the coral is already deadthe impact on what remainscould be devastating It doesnt have the resilience to fight back from that

journey from Syria Swedish bureaucracy and local tensions to start a new business Now they need their reboot of the family craft to thrive reports Richard Orange from MalmMohannad Sabbagh deftly whips a copper scoop into the rotating cauldron in front of him pulling it out loaded with hot salt My body is a thermometer he grins as he dabs his palm lightly on the surface My hand is what measures the temperature Sabbagh 20 has been roasting cashews pistachios chick peas and melon seeds in exactly this way ever since his father sent him out aged 12 to work at the family roastery near Bab Touma gate in Damascuss old city The cauldron heated by a dull diesel flame is not so different from the one his greatgrandfather used back in 1913 when he launched his roastery a Damascus institution that is still going strong today Some Syrian refugees in Germany have made arrangements to return home voluntarily DW has spoken to a few of these refugees about the challenges they face 27012017 Viennas Habibi Hawara restaurant employs a dozen mainly Syrian refugees But its not just a job The goal is to teach newcomers how to run a company in Austria reports Matteo Tacconi 22102016 The challenge of integrating large numbers of refugees from the Middle East is nothing new for Sweden A dozen years ago the country opened its doors to Iraqis with mixed results Richard Orange reports from Malm 21102015 But we are not in Syria We are in a drab industrial estate on a cold wet January morning in Malm the city in Sweden to which Sabbagh and his brother Moumen fled in December and October 2015 respectively during the last wave of Europes refugee crisis Together with their old Damascus neighbors Jehad and Mamoun Abo Rokba the brothers hope to bring a taste of home to the 112000 Syrians who have fled to Sweden since civil war began five years ago The Syrians love it Its like their dream shop has opened Sabbagh says of Delicious Rosteri which opened three weeks ago in Mllevaangen Square the center of the citys immigrant population with a dabka folk dancefeaturing bagpipes and tambourines Lavishly decorated with gold cladding the shop sells more than 90 varieties of nuts from its wooden drawers Whoever knows it from Damascus they will come on the basis of the name The flavor is known its like a franchise like IKEA Sabbaghjokes The brothers also hope to serve the rest of the citys Arab population and even lure in the occasional Swede Spurred on by suffering Back at the factory Sabbaghpokes his nose over the cauldron and smells the now halfroasted chickpeas an expression of exaggerated delight spreading over his face Its not the flame that roasts the nuts its the hot salt he explains enthusiastically because the seeds will burn if exposed to raw flame or hot metal The roasting machine the four spinning barrels used to flavor the nuts the copper scoop even the rubber baskets made from old car tires everything has been shipped from Syria by his father Send Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink httpdwcomp2TFIN All of the ways of making this roastery are oldschool because we want the old taste to stay he says We did consider new roasting techniques but it lacks the flavor We want it to taste the way it tasted 50 years ago Once roasted the nuts must be sold quickly to retain their flavor and nutritional value Nuts which have sat in storage for months after being imported from Iraq or Egypt quickly absorb moisture and grow a patina of mould It hasnt been easy Sabbagh whistles and looks theatrically at the ceiling when asked about his monthlong journey from Turkey which began when the boat he joined to cross over to Greece began to sink into the cold December waters of the Aegean He was rescued and then arrested before making the long overland journey to Sweden all the time fearing that by the time he got here the rules would have changed to prevent him from being able to stay But if it wasnt for this suffering we wouldnt have such motivation to start a business like this he smiles It makes us appreciate it more The brothers and their partners are in a hurry They rented premises and imported the machines within months of arriving in the city only to discover that Swedens authorities didnt look too kindly on burning diesel with an open flame in an enclosed space Getting a license took a frustrating eight months and required installing an expensive ventilation system When they went to Almi a Swedish government bank which funds and advises immigrants starting small businesses they were advised to give up They said your project isnt going to work shrugs Mamoun Abo Rokba who worked as a lawyer in Syria before fleeing three years ago and now handles the business sideSo I went straight back to the workshop and started to make it happen Local tensions What Abo Rokba and the alSabbagh brothers have going for them is the backing of their prosperous Damascus families The Sabbagh family owns five roasteries while Abo Rokbas father runs a company importing medical equipment This is not unusual for Syrians in Sweden who are often richer and better educated than the Iraqis who came in the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq The family behind theJasmin alSham restaurant which opened in the middle of the citys main pedestrian street last April owned four paper tissue factories in the Syrian city of Homs They spent hundreds of thousands of euros converting an old branch of Pizza Hut into a replica of a Damascene house But the perceived arrogance with which Malms newly arrived Syrians splash money around and the attentionseeking dabka dances they arrange to launch new businesses generate not a little resentment among established Arabs There is that sentiment admits Abo Rokba You can feel it Theyre not happy with whatever you started People tend to forget that we didnt come here by choice We were forced to leave Syria Mohannad Sabbagh and his brother are carrying on a family tradition with Delicious Rosteri But Syrians like him arent willing to spend years living on benefits while they study Svenksa fr Invandrare SFI Swedish for immigrants the slowmoving language program which is the official first step to integration in Sweden Syrians dont like to stay at home and wait for things to happen he says SFI doesnt get you a job We dont want to be a burden we want to be an active part of society Abo Rokbahas just come back from a business meeting in Austria where he discussed exporting his freshly roasted nuts He has plans to set up another roastery in Berlin He is thinking of adding freshly roasted Arabic coffee to the product line Back at the factory Sabbagh inserts a metal bucket into the cauldron and chickpeas and salt begin to cascade down a ramp the chickpeas into rubber baskets and the salt falling through holes to floor to be used again He scoops up a handful of the hot nuts and pours them into my hand You will taste the flavor of Sham now he exclaims A taste of old Syria

and parents to protect ourselves online,The annual Safer Internet Day is all about kids and how to protect them online But its about all of us really Parents need to know how to help their kids and sometimes the kids can help the oldsWhat are the threats for kids online Official advice on internet safety tends to focus on a few main threats In late 2015 the UK government published measures to keep children safe online at school and at home It includes cyber bullying pornography and the risk of radicalization as major threats It refers to some school children who travelled or attempted to travel to Syria were able to access material about Daesh Islamic State or ISIS and foreign fighters via school computers In September 2016 the German government advice listed the same basic threats but replaced radicalization with the risk of gruesome violent imagery And its all true but a bit vague to be honest The United States Department of Justice DOJ however dives right into the detail Children may come into contact with demeaning racist sexist violent hateful or false information The advice is dated October 24 2016 so it can be safely assumed the reference to hateful and false information has nothing to do with President Donald Trump or his administrations tampering of government websites It then skips over pornography SPAM containing obscene material and file swapping programs with inappropriate and sometimes mislabeled content before stating that most worrisome children may encounter actual predators that use the internet to identify and lure victims through chat rooms instant messaging facilities and social networking sites So what can kids and parents do to surf the net safely Well the DOJ says that due to first amendment rights to free speech various types of information can be posted in the web some of which a parent may find inappropriate for their children to view It then goes on to recommend parents snoop on their kids which on one level counters that very idea of free speech But we are talking about protecting kids so perhaps snooping is the only way certainly when kids hit those secretive teen years While you mull that over let me give you more from the DOJ Itll help you decide ° Do not post personal information online or your picture it can be copied changed or used to find you ° Do not post your plans and activities in a chat room Do not post entries that make it clear no one is at your home And do not use location services they reveal your location in realtime ° Do not communicate with people who make you feel uncomfortable or afraid This no doubt is meant to help you steer clear of cyber bullies But bullies are predators and sometimes simply walking away isnt enough So what do you do then Find someone you trust like your parents or a teacher Parents says the DOJ should ensure their kids computers are in a public space even in the home This neatly ignores concealed messaging on smartphones and watches but you get the idea Its also suggested you know your kids passwords and read through their emails regularly perhaps also follow them on social media This is understandable up to a point but it could have devastating effects on trust within your family And when that trust is bust who do you think your kids will turn to So try talking to your kids before spying on them And kids how about you share with your parents before they feel the urge to track you like a troll For instance if you come across images that upset you online talk to your parents They may not have all the answers but itll be better than keeping it secret Amanda Todd a 15yearold and cyber bullying victim called for help in a YouTube video before committing suicide You should also talk to your parents before buying apps or inapp purchases and before joining online groups and games Involve them and seek their advice its no reason to be ashamed Oh and speaking of shame Try to avoid sexting Itll only come back to bite you in the or send you head first into a case of revenge porn Not good Dont internet companies bear responsibility Yes companies should bear responsibility and some do Take the UK Council for Child Internet Safety Its worked with internet service providers and telcos like BT and Everything Everywhere as well as social media companies like Facebook and the makers of the massively multiplayer online game MMO and virtual world Club Penguin to produce a set of universal guidelines Its advice on effective internet safety messages for providers Granted its just words mere talk where engagement is whats needed But talk is often a first step The very same information is aimed at schools This is vital as increasingly education is done directly on networked mobile devices Teachers are on the frontline Theres also Googles Internet Legends which goes on tour to educate primary school children on online safetyItsSafety Centre gives advice on managing your online reputation It says make smart connections and on cyber bullying or cybermobbing as its called in Germany it encourages you to be an upstander not a bystander And this is all well and good But quite often parents those people who are closest to you kids are not the most internetsavvy people So sometimes internet safety has to be built in The German government points to two childsafe search engines fragFinnde which may require extra childprotection software and blindekuhde And klicksafede is an EUdriven portal with loads of information on safety online Or obfuscateFor advanced users among us refraining from posting personal information is just the start Some people protect themselves online through direct action As Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum write in Obfuscation there are ways to spray false meaningless information to hide yourself in the noise or disrupt another conversation There are ethical issues at stake possibly even legal ones obfuscation can be used for good and bad So its to be deployed with care Check out a Safer Internet Day 2017 action near you

266,2017/2/6,http://www.dw.com/en/maastricht-treaty-not-yet-set-in-stone/a-37435390?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf,Maastricht Treaty not yet set in stone,Its been 25 years since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty which among other things included provisions that have to be met to join the euro After all these years however they have proved to be mere paper tigersThe two most important elements of these provisions known as the convergence criteria concern fiscal discipline mandating member states to limit their annual budget deficits to less than three percent of their respective economic output while instructing them to hold their national debt to under 60 percent of gross domestic product GDP Germany was the driving force behind the inclusion of these provisions in the agreement even though the threepercent rule on budget deficits had originally been conceived by a young French official Guy Abeille a lowranking employee in the French finance ministry was tasked in 1982 to come up with a way to control the problem of runaway fiscal deficits a product of then French President Francois Mitterrands expansive spending policies The French governments budget deficit at the time roughly amounted to 26 percent of GDP Abeille therefore was of the view that a one percent ceiling on the deficit would be unrealistic even adhering to a two percent ceiling would be an onerous task for the government Thats why he suggested a three percent upper limit and the simple and arbitrary manner in which the rule came into being It was then later incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty as an important criterion that has to be met by potential member states to join the European monetary union The rule on keeping the level of national debt below 60 percent of GDP was arbitrary says Oliver Sivering Arbitrary decisions Even the rule on keeping the level of national debt below 60 percent of GDP was arbitrary says Oliver Sievering of the College of Public Administration and Finance in the southern German city of Ludwigsburg In the early 1990s many countries debt levels were around 60 percent of GDP The two figures were then intertwined to come up with the debt and deficit rules Sievering told DW If the economy grows nominally by five percent the new debt may rise by three percent And this was used as the basis for coming up with an upper limit on debt of 60 percent of GDP But it quickly became clear that achieving an annual growth rate of five percent was far from realistic It was also evident that countries like Belgium Italy and Greece wouldnt be able to meet the 60 percent target As a result one had to just take comfort from the fact that the debt situation of these countries was moving in a positive direction and focus on the threepercentdeficit target A convergence report published in 1998 by the European Monetary Institute shows that except for Greece all other potential eurozone candidates showed a fiscal deficit of less than three percent of GDP Fresh eurozone economic data show that inflation has risen to just below the ECBs key target growth is accelerating and unemployment has hit a sevenyear low suggesting the blocs economy is finally on the mend 31012017 An adviser to President Trump says the euro served as a currency for Germany alone allowing it to exploit its EU partners and the US Is it worthwhile to confront this nonsense with facts asks DWs Rolf Wenkel 02022017 A poll by an investment consultancy has shown that more investors than ever consider a breakup of the eurozone likely in the next 12 months Italys woes are in focus but its not the only potential trouble spot 29112016 Hans Tietmeyer held a major leadership role in two of Germanys most important transitions in recent memory Reunification and the introduction of the euro currency His passing has been confirmed by the central bank 28122016 Some countries including Germany resorted to a number of tricks to show that they complied with the requirement For instance the German government sold shares in firms like Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Post to the stateowned development bank KfW in a bid to show that it reduced its debt level Italy meanwhile introduced a European tax on its citizens only to repay most of it after the introduction of the euro Not a good example The two Maastricht criteria are meant to be respected even after entering the eurozone club to guarantee the solidity of the currency and the monetary area Germany in particular has always insisted on their compliance However Europes largest economy together with France violated the deficit limit in 2002 and yet both Berlin and Paris managed to avoid paying billions in fines and softened the strict rules Since then it has been quite detrimental to budgetary discipline in the euro area as it gave a chance to other countries to say if Germany and France do not adhere to the criteria why should we stick to them noted Sievering At the height of the financial crisis almost all countries exceeded the budget deficit target Although most eurozone countries have managed to rein in their deficits they still have a long way to go when it comes to their debt In 2015 for example it was only Latvia Lithuania Estonia the Czech Republic Slovakia and Luxembourg whose debts were below the 60 percent threshold While Germany recorded a budget surplus again in 2016 its national debt was hovering around 70 percent of GDP way above the prescribed limit Although the Maastricht criteria have been violated innumerable times no penalty has so far been imposed on any violator No one wants to impose a fine on the other because every country knows that in a few years it could face a similar situation and would be glad if it were let off the hook underlined Sievering In other words potential perpetrators judge current culprits Despite the ineffectiveness of the compliance mechanism Sievering views the rules as indispensable He points out that just paying attention to the criteria and discussingthem hasa disciplining effect

bank is set to invest about 120 million in the Dakota Access Pipeline which threatens a Native American reservation and drinking water Other banks have already sold their stakeThere arent many members of the Sioux tribe living in Bavaria but thanks to the tentacles of international finance the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline DAPL being built near the Standing Rock Indian Reservationin the UShave reachedthe streets ofMunich Last week protesters from an alliance of NGOs arrived on the doorstepof the BayernLB bank to deliver more than 700000 signatures They had beencollected via worldwide petitions against DAPLs17 financial investors including the Bavarian state bank which is contributing 120 million 111 million eurosof the total 25 billion costMore than 220000 signatures were on a petition specifically aimed at BayernLB though that figure had almostclimbed to 300000byMonday 6 Despite an invitation from environmental campaigners Urgewald BayernLBdeclined to send any representatives outside the building to receive the petition But we were allowed to go in with a delegation of three people and we gave the petition to the press spokesman said Regine Richter banking specialist at Urgewald The bank itself is unwilling to give interviews on the subject and in response to DWs request would only send the public statement it issued in December which had made many conciliatory noises BayernLB is following the running discussions about the route of the pipeline very carefully and as part of the consortium financing the pipeline supports an amicable result of the discussions between the parties it read Wait and see BayernLB added that it was waiting on a report from the US law firm Foley Hoagcommissioned in December to look into how the local indigenous people had been consulted onthe project That report is due out later this month but it may come too late because within days of taking officein January US President Donald Trump signed an executive order decreeing that the environmental review for the project be fasttracked Nobody is really sure that means but we are concerned that DAPL could get the green light any day now Nick Pelosi corporate engagement director for the campaign group First Peoples Worldwide told DWIts such an urgent matter at this point that we really dont have time Not only thatPelosi is also concerned that the study is being conducted behind closed doors and may be no more than a desktopassessment From what we understand it is a study on tribal consultation which is the crux of this issue that the tribe was not consulted properly about this pipeline Pelosi said But nobodys reached out to the tribe so its essentially a study on consultation without any consultation All 17 banks insist that the loans for DAPLare now legally committed But some have shown concern and that they are willing to exert the limited influence that they have Pelosi said I definitely think theyre feeling the pressure he said But what the tribe is asking is not necessarily for the banks to pull out but to use their influence as project lenders to pressure the company into rerouting to avoid their treaty territory The banksinfluence appears to be very limited indeedThey argue that they cant impose new conditions on the loans and that it isnt their role to determine the route Which is true its the US governments responsibility but were asking them to support the reroute not dictate it Pelosi said Dozens of protesters have been arrested at the Standing Rock reservation Passive bank Compared with other banks BayernLB has been particularly recalcitrant BayernLB was one of the few that outright rejected our request for dialogue said Pelosi BayernLB is being much too passive Richter said Banks like the Dutch ING and the Norwegian DNB are at least expressing public criticism of the pipeline consortiums behavior or are selling stakes in the companies involved Meanwhile in Germany BayernLBs involvement in the project has raised some political hackles firstly because it is partly owned by the state and secondly because it received a colossal taxpayerfunded 10billioneuro 93billion bailout during Europes financial crisis in 2008 BayernLB should not be allowed to support the dirty business of climate denier Donald Trump said Anton Hofreiter the Greens parliamentary leader and a native of Bavaria This project destroys the environment is a risk for the drinking water from the Missouri Riverandat the same timedesecrates the Native Americans cultural heritage Hofreiter along with other German politicians is sure that BayernLBs commitment to the project could be reversed by Bavarias state government Im sure its possible Frank Schwabe Bundestag member for the Social Democrats told DW The bank has oversight committees and there is political influence on that so it would be good if the politicians in Bavaria would take a clear position on it Were discussing the issue of company and bank responsibility more and more and I think that a state bank in particular needs to stick to that

burden of refugees a position that circumvents many countries continued opposition to refugee resettlement and at most means a sharing of the financial burden In late 2014 with the war in Syria approaching its fourth year and Islamic State making gains in the north of the country the exodus of Syrians intensified At the same time others were fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Iraq Afghanistan Eritrea Somalia Niger and Kosovo Vast numbers of Syrian refugees had been gathering in bordertown camps in neighboring Turkey Lebanon and Jordan since 2011 By 2015 with the camps full to bursting and residents often unable to find work or educate their children more and more people decided to seek asylum further afield In 2015 an estimated 15 million people made their way on foot from Greece towards western Europe via the Balkan route The Schengen Agreement which allows passportfree travel within much of the EU was called into question as refugees headed towards the wealthier European nations Tens of thousands of refugees were also attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean on overcrowded boats In April 2015 800 people of various nationalities drowned when a boat traveling from Libya capsized off the Italian coast This was to be just one of many similar tragedies by the end of the year nearly 4000 refugees were reported to have died attempting the crossing Countries along the EUs external border struggled to cope with the sheer number of arrivals Fences were erected in Hungary Slovenia Macedonia and Austria Asylum laws were tightened and several Schengen area countries introduced temporary border controls Critics of German Chancellor Angela Merkels opendoor refugee policy claimed it had made the situation worse by encouraging more people to embark on the dangerous journey to Europe By September 2016 Germany had also introduced temporary checks on its border with Austria In early 2016 the EU and Turkey signed an agreement under which refugees arriving in Greece could be sent back to Turkey The deal has been criticised by human rights groups and came under new strain following a vote by the European Parliament in November to freeze talks on Turkeys potential accession to the EU With antiimmigration sentiment in Europe growing governments are still struggling to reach a consensus on how to handle the continuing refugee crisis Attempts to introduce quotas for the distribution of refugees among EU member states have largely failed Conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere show no signs coming to an end and the death toll from refugee sea crossings is on the rise Author Rachel Stewart Points of clarification A lack of concrete ideas from Poland makes cooperation especially difficult for Berlin A panEuropean military is a prime example an idea both Kaczynski and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have now and then thrown into the mix It remains unclear what the Visegrad Group Poland the Czech Republic Slovakia and Hungary actually want Polands government has its reasons to view Brexit and Trump differently than Germanys does Both pose problems for Germany which could allow Poland with its governments lukewarm stance towards the EU a chance to strengthen its position and significance writes the political scientist Olaf Osica in Tygodnik Powszechny The Polish political establishment takes umbrage with the German inability to accept other points of view based on its steadfast conviction in its own universal policies believed capable of solving nearly every problem in the world Citing a number of policy differences migration energy climate and the Eurozone among them Osica concludes that these are independent of the party in power and have been openly debated only since the change in government It is hoped that themeeting with Merkel will be a serious conversation about serious topics and the defining of common interests

demonetization policy,Five Indian states are electing new governments over the next few weeks The votes will prove to be a key test of PM Modis popularity which has taken a hit due to his demonetization move Murali Krishnan reportsIndians went to the polls on Saturday February 4 in the first two of five state elections that experts say are a major popularity test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi The premiers approval ratings have dropped since his controversial move in November last year to scrap highdenomination currency notes dubbed locally as demonetization Weeks after Modi announced thedrastic move to withdraw all 500 and 1000rupee notes from circulation the monetary situation in Asias thirdlargest economy has yet to normalize and most people across the country continue to face problems accessing cash for their daily needs The government has said the move will bring billions of unaccounted money into the formal banking system and clean Indias economy of black money a term used in the country to refer to unaccounted untaxed wealth But since the announcement serpentine queues have lined up outside banks and ATMs of people replacing their rupee notes or making small withdrawals And Modis administration has faced sharp criticism over the slow pace of introducing the new notes with banks running out of cash and ATMs having to be recalibrated to cope with the different sized bills a process that is still incomplete The Indian governments recent surprise decision to ban all highvalue currency notes in circulation has affected almost everyone in the country Economist Rajiv Biswas talks to DW about the effectiveness of the move 24112016 One of the worlds fastest growing economies is projected to experience a slowdown in the current fiscal year Indias

highvalue banknote ban hitting the countrys economic growth the government has announced a plethora of sops to ease the pain 01022017 The Indian economys high reliance on cash only adds to the crisis Furthermore many in the South Asian nation lack proper access to banks and financial services The uncertainty caused by the shock decision has also led foreign investors to withdraw huge amounts of capital from the country and put it elsewhere The resulting slide in the rupee has sparked speculation that the countrys central bank may intervene to shore up the currency Crucial elections The state elections are being held against this backdropThe five states where the votes are taking place are home to a fifth of the countrys 125 billionstrong population While the voters in the western states of Punjab and Goa cast their ballots on Saturday polls will be held in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in the north and Manipur in the northeast between February 11 and March 8 As predicted by political analysts the demonetization controversy has dominated the crucial state elections Opposition parties are trying to use the currency controversy to their advantage as the rural population in the states has faced the brunt of the premiers demonetization decision In the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh farmers are finding it difficult to buy pesticides for the winter crops It is a serious issue as cash scarcity has affected vast swathes of Indias rural hinterland If the objective of the demonetization move was to target the rich it has not been effective Vinod Singh afarmer from Uttar Pradesh told DW The election in Uttar Pradesh is crucial for Modi given its enormous significance in Indian politics Being the most populous state in the country with over 200 million inhabitantsit elects the highest number of lawmakers to both houses of Indian parliament Modis Hindunationalist Bharatiya Janata Party BJP won 73 out of the states 80 Lok Sabha the lower house of parliament seats in the 2014

transformed at night into an establishment where homeless and those in need are served a sophisticated dinner for free Hagar Jobse reportsMaria Marte migrated to Spain in 2003 and started washing dishes in a Madrid restaurant She stayed despite the economic crisis and is now a head chef with two Michelin stars to her name Guy Hedgecoe reports 01082015 The financial crisis that began in 2008 obliterated millions of jobs in Spain In the wake of the meltdown around half of those under 30 are still unable to find a job Santiago Saez reports from Madrid and Huelva 29122016 Spanish Twitter users are accusing the Catholic Church of prioritizing its presence in the media over traditional relief work Others say the criticism is hypocritical 25012016 The worst of having to queue for your food is the shame says Olga who prefers not to reveal her last name while she takes a bite of her Spanish omelette Olga a tiny woman with grey hair pulled into a ponytail has been unemployed for almost 10 years She has a roof above her head but the monthly 400 euros 430 she receives from the Spanish government are not enough to make it until the end of the month So she has had to queue up outside waiting for the social services to give her a sandwich I am always afraid a family member or friend will see me she tells DW I went to university you know What if I ran into someone from my class What would they think But tonight Olga doesnt have to stand in line for food She is sitting at a table in Madrids recently opened Robin Hood restaurant a fairly ordinary looking Spanish bar with a cigarette machine in the corner and a ham leg on the counter Here Olga is served dinner by professional waiters Every half hour she is asked whether she wants another drink or a refill on her soup During the day the Robin Hood restaurant is a regular establishment where customers pay 11 euros for a fixed menu But at night the place transforms into an establishment where homeless and people in need like Olga are served a sophisticateddinner for free The businessmodel is simple the earnings made at breakfast and lunch fund the evening meals for the homeless The Robin Hood restaurant uses its daytime earnings to fund meals for the homeless Messengers of peace The restaurant is the latest initiative launched by the charity organization Mensajeros de la Paz which means messengers of peace and was founded 54 years ago by priest Angel Garcia Rodriguez In conservative Spain Father Angel as he is often called is a revolutionary For example the church he opened two years ago in Madrids trendy Chueca neighborhood is open 247 has a WiFi connection and features livestreams from the Vatican and religious films During the winter months homeless are allowed to sleep on the church benches When DW assists a service at the San Anton Church on Sunday it is packed with people listening to Father Angels sermon Unlike in other churches people are walking in and out and mumbling quietly After the service Father Angel explains why the noise doesnt bother him In most churches you need to be silent We dont want to tell people how they must behave We want them to feel welcome he tells DW Finding a connection San Anton Church offers free WiFi to homeless people Father Angel says the idea to open the Robin Hood restaurant was inspired by Pope Francis He always speaks about how important is to give people dignity It is not only about giving food to the poor its also about how you give it to them So seeing the long lines of people waiting outside in the cold for food I thought why dont we serve these people food in a restaurant with proper cutlery and crystal glasses instead of plastic cups Theeconomic crisisin Spain has had a severe impact on the country and Spanish charities like Mensajeros de la Paz are still dealing with the consequences 30 percent of Spaniards are living close to poverty and 300000 people in the country are homeless Helping the homeless Currently 100 homeless and people in need selected by the social services of Madrid can have dinner at Robin Hood every night They have a table reserved for them just like paying customers when they go out for dinner Father Angel explains And it is that reservation Antonio Pachon 62 looks forward to every day Pachon has been living on the streets of different cities in Spain since he left his native Seville in 1996 During the day I usually wander around the city by myself he explains Its nice to have a place like this where a seat is waiting for me and where I can talk with people I know As soon as I

to the restaurant the place is packed Elena Sanchez and a friend are just finishing desert They think the food is wonderful and are glad they can help other people by coming here Since the economic crisis in 2008 so many people have gotten into deep financial trouble after losing their jobs Sanchez thinks the Spanish government hasnt come up with enough solutions to fightpoverty in Spain There

277,2017/2/6,http://www.dw.com/en/first-german-supermarket-sells-waste-food-only/a-37426777?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf,First German supermarket sells waste food only,The first supermarket to sell only salvaged food waste has opened in Germany It marks a small step towards a zerowaste society but a major shift in social awareness says DW reporter Irene Banos RuizFrom curious grannies to committed foodsavers everyone who came to The Good Food when it opened on February 4was excited by ashop unlike anything they had ever encountered before The store in the German city of Cologne is the first of its kind in the country and thethird one in the European Union It sellsproducts of all kinds from vegetables to beer And the unusual thing is that all these products would otherwise have been destroyed as waste The other peculiar thing about The Good Food is that there are no fixed prices Consumers decide how much they think a product is worth You only need to take one look at the figures to understand why Nicole Klaski decided to start The Good Food Every year one third of the food produced in the world gets wasted If we saved just a quarter of that wasted food we could feed almost 900 million hungry people according to theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO Klaski and Thurn want to stop food waste Valentin Thurn is an author and the awardwinning director of the Taste the Waste documentary He came along to the opening to celebrate what he sees as a positive move to combat food waste But he also told DW there were still major challenges to be overcome This idea is simply great Thurn said I still cannot understand why we throw so much food away The starting point Well actually he says he does have some idea The trade knows we prefer to buy something that looks perfect he said Indeed the FAOs information shows that at retail level food is mostly wasted because it does not look attractive Klaski told DW it was time to take action to change this She goes into fields after they have been harvested and collects the vegetables left behind Some of them are deemed too big some too small some just too ugly to sell In her shop the organic food then becomes accessible to everyone using a pay what you think system Buyers can also find nonperishable products from big manufacturers which have passed their sellby dates A customer checks the label on a bottle from the past the date but delicious shelf No one wants to throw the food away Klaski said We save the vegetables and expired products and the producers are happy that their food is still eaten For her the system is a winwin cooperation What about health risks Some of the curious visitors having a look around The Good Food admitted they would not buy certain products if they were past the date Others however said it was easy to tell by the color or smell if a product was still in good condition or not Klaski herself is not worried that there could be health risks involved The expiry dates on products are only a suggestion for the consumer she told DW Most of the products last much longer But in the unfortunate event that someone really did get sick someone has to carry the responsibility That is why Klaski says the team takes their duty very seriously to inform consumers when a product is out of date And of course if something happens we will have to take the responsibility she added But we are even willing to do that it is worth trying Part of a broader movement Contrary to traditional supermarkets aim of making a profit The Good Food aims at having a social impact Pay what you like says the sign on these products Our highest expectation is to raise awareness on the problem food waste represents said Anja Rickert a member of the team at The Good Food She believes initiatives like this can motivate people who were not previously aware of issues relating to a sustainable lifestyle Klaski is convinced that once the first step is taken the rest follows on The food waste shop is part of a broader movement to reduce consumption and be aware of how we consume she said The furniture used for instance is all second hand or recycled And most of the consumers seem to share the same philosophy Coming here represents more than just buying food it is a way of life one of the clients told DW Beyond the social movement Author and filmmaker Valentin Thurn has observed a huge change in attitudes since he produced Taste the Waste in 2010 At that time nobody spoke about food waste literally nobody Thurn said Now many people are involved even politicians However despite strong social movements such as foodsharing food waste remains one of the major challenges of our time Merchandising the leftovers is not enough to combat it Thurn is

6 Deutsche Welles Germanlanguage program will see its cultural content boosted DWs head of culture Rolf Rische explains howDW Whats new about the Germanlanguage program offered by DW Rolf Rische DWs new Germanlanguage TV programs will includemuch more cultural content than before We interpret culture in a very broad sense We dont want to talk only about cultural highlights in literature film and music but also about cultures social dimensions for instance traditions and values Our new program isnt just the TV equivalent of the feature pages of a traditional newspaperitsmuch more exciting television that keeps our audience uptodate on culture business sportsscienceand so much more As always with DW you can watch the German program anywhere in the world For live stream access via the internet simply click on the Live TV button in the upper left corner You can also watch most shows per video on demand on the DWwebsite under the heading TV Viewers are sure to find their favorites from Europe in Concert and Kino to Kulturzeit and Shift Viewers can also use the DW App under TV live to follow the German TV program on their phones Of course the German TV program will also continue to be broadcast in the usual manner reaching Eastern Europe Asia Oceania North and South America via satellite Direct reception is only possible with a very large satellite dish but DW has more than 250 broadcast partners offering the entire range of DWs German TV program Multichoice gives viewers in South Africa and nine other African countries access to the Germanlanguage program in its DSTv Premium channel Viewers in Canada can turn to Shaw Cablesystems for DWs German broadcasts Who is your target audience Each and every viewer interested in Germany and Europe or in German and European points of view And of course everyone who enjoys culture and who wouldnt Rolf Rische is DWs head of culture and society and German TV If you have a look at the schedule youll see were truly offering a lot of culture New genuine culturalcontent such as the music magazine PopXport on Mondays ofeachweekas well as anew show called Kulturzeit that willairfive days a week and that is acquiredfrom broadcasters ZDF ORF SRF and ARD Sundays watch out for the successful andpopular show Kultur21 Then we have a set of new shows that are all about literature druckfrischlesenswert and B��cherjournal give us the opportunity to present a weekly literature broadcast I know no other program that has such a spectrum Another novelty isan almost onehourlong current affairs show entitled Der Tag with a daily guest and a special slot for culturalcontent Those are just three of a seriesof additions that promise to make the program more exciting as well as giving it a clear culturalprofile Will most of that content focus on highbrow culture No by no means Perhaps the line between serious highbrow culture and entertainment is more pronounced in Germany than elsewhere but that is not true for us the creators of the television programs For us theres only good culture and perhaps less good culture Most of all we want to get our audience interested in good movies good music good books no matter whether they belong to the high culture or the pop culture category Who would dismiss the unrivaled electronic music band Kraftwerkas unimportant entertainment but automatically categorize the one millionth performance of the opera Tosca on a second rate stage as high culture People who live in ivory towers and would rather stay there isolated thats who We on the other hand are always on the lookout for qualitybeyond what I regard as totally superfluous categories Take our awardwinning filmTeodor Currentzis the classical rebel which tells the story of a conductor and his orchestra working on Mozarts Don Giovanni In a way that is high culture but most of all its a highly entertaining movie Its a quality film and the protagonists Teodor Currentzis and the MusicAeterna orchestra are really good too Forget the distinctions between highbrow and popular culture to focus on whats good such as Kraftwerk That said we plan to continue to show music documentaries but also German comedy shows like Ladies Night and Nuhr Of course we will also continue to broadcast the entertaining shows that have had a loyal audience for many years including the daily Euromaxx Leben und Kultur in Europathe travel show Checkin and the music show PopXport Why are you focusing on culture at this point Mainly because the viewers are very interested in culture as DWs market and media researchers have found out In addition its a perfect fit with DWs chartered mission According to the DW Act the broadcaster is intended to convey the image of Germany as a cultural state in the European tradition and as a free and democratic constitutional state They should provide a forum in Europe and on other continents for German and other points of view on important topics primarily in the areas of politics culture and economics Promoting understanding and the exchange of ideas among different cultures and peoples is Deutsche Welles mission And that is what we hope to achieve with the new Germanlanguage program There simply is no better approach to the values and identity of a society than via culture By nature the dialogue of cultures nurtures understanding In these uneasy times one is tempted to rephrase a wellknown decadesold German advertising slogan for a tonic based on natural herbs Culture never more valuable than today

anniversary of the day Elizabeth became Queen of England She is the first British monarch to reach a Blue Sapphire Jubilee Here are more records broken by Her MajestyElizabeth ascended the throne at the age of 25 on February 6 1952 the day her father King George VI died Already the longestreigning British monarch since 2015 Queen Elizabeth II is now making history once again by becoming the first to celebrate a Sapphire Jubilee The gallery above goes through some of the records detained by monarchs in the UK and around the world A traditional gun salute and a performance by the Band of the Royal Artillery is planned to underline the recordbreaking anniversary However celebrations should remain limited this year The Queen is said to want to quietly devote the day to her fathers memory Larger celebrations could however be planned for the Queens next big anniversary her Platinum Jubilee in 2022 As the gallery below shows no matter how big or small the event Her Majesty certainly knows how to dress for every occasion The Queens outfits are legendary Her fancy hats always match with her suits and her hemlines are weighted down to prevent windy wardrobe embarrassments Then theres the handbag It always has the same shape Classic black its just big enough to hold her lipstick reading glasses mint lozenges and a handkerchief Thats how the world has known her for the past 60 years Queen Elizabeth II rarely shows up bareheaded She has hats in all shapes and colors Some are light and playful trimmed with little flowers while others look strict and sober They always match with her outfits Who could tell how many she actually has Its one of the worlds bestkept secrets Even when she was younger she was the queen of headgear Here she is on the beach donning a casual hippy style This picture belongs to a series of historical photos of the Queen which were auctioned in 2008 A private collector can now smile with her every day Even a princess needs to pitch in During World War II Elizabeth Windsor was part of the Auxiliary Territorial Service the womens division of the British Army She learned mechanics and how to drive trucks This picture was taken in 1945 once again with headgear Two years after the war Elizabeth married her childhood sweetheart Prince Phillip of Greece and Denmark Hundreds of ration coupons were collected to purchase her wedding gown After the war it was still difficult to obtain such valuable materials even for the royal house The satin dress was embroidered with 10000 pearls and crystals and had a fourmeterlong 13foot bridal train of lace At the coronation ceremony On June 2 1953 she wore a white silk dress with colorful embroideries representing the emblems of the Commonwealth of Nations Attached to her shoulders a fivemeterlong 16foot velvet mantle was carried by six maids of honor It was billed the visit of the century In May 1965 the Queen was West Germanys most welcome official foreign guest 56 years had gone by since the last visit by a British state official and two wars during which both countries had experienced great suffering Queen Elizabeth II spent 11 days traveling through the young Federal Republic and charmed the Germans with her outfits After Elizabeth II enchanted Germany with her whimsical hats she opted for a more traditional style for her Austrian state visit in 1969 She wore a white silk dress with a red sash and a diadem instead of a hat In 1978 Elizabeth II came to Germany for the second time Although she was once again received with great pomp the procession was more modest than the one for her first visit Over the years normalcy and even friendship characterized the two countries relations Former German president Walter Scheel pictured here contributed to consolidating these ties In February 1972 the Queen visited King Bhumibol in Thailand Shed obviously have a stately gown and diadem in her suitcase but also a few playful outfits as well with matching hats of course Even though its cheerful her summery ensemble on this picture doesnt seem frivolous Nothing can diminish her royal style not even these 3D glasses The Queen wore them while visiting the University of Sheffield where she was invited to operate an excavator with a 3D display When the Queen is not on state visits she often prefers a modest headscarf to her designer hats Suddenly the royal guise is concealed She rather looks like a goodnatured grandmother pictured here in 2012 She kept it tweedy while riding with the former US President Ronald Reagan in 1982 The Queen showed him around the grounds of Windsor Castle her favorite residence On July 29 1981 Elizabeths son Prince Charles married Lady Diana in what was considered the fairytale wedding of the century Although the Queen apparently played a major role in the couples union she didnt manage to steal the spotlight from her daughterinlaw that day not even in bright turquoise When Prince William married Kate in 2011 the Queen wore a much more relaxed dress than at the wedding of Charles and Diana Here shes pictured arriving at Westminster Abbey in a sober yellow outfit Every year for the Queens speech she traditionally wears her official royal regalia The speech always marks the formal beginning of a new legislative period for the British Parliament and outlines the projects of the government for the upcoming session The Queen still dresses up in royal robes Here she is with Prince Philip in front of Saint Pauls Cathedral during a church service in honor of the Order of the British Empire a highly respected order of merit The Queen turned 90 in 2016 Although she was born on April 21 1926 her official birthday is celebrated in June because the weather is usually nicer for outdoor ceremonies On June 13 2015 she drove through London with her husband Prince Philip in an allwhite suit which matched her hair perfectly Author Silke W��nsch eg

RB Leipzig beat the big boys Is Mahmoud Dahoud back on track under Hecking All this and more in this weeks Bundesliga talking pointsDahoud front and center of Heckings revolution Although Lars Stindls individual goal in Borussia Mnchengladbachs win over Freiburg will undoubtedly be the highlight worth watching this weekend do spare a thought for the wonderful onetwo between Raffael and Mahmoud Dahoud for the Foals second goal The young attacking midfielder has reverted back to looking very much like the prodigy that first burst on the scene last season Its seems no coincidence that this has happened so soon after Dieter Hecking took over as coach Against Freiburg Bayer Leverkusen last week and Darmstadt the week before Dahoud has pulled strings and dictated play at the very heart of Heckings newlook side And as such the Foals have quickly begun moving up the league table now back up to tenth Lewandowskireliant Bayern finally stumble Robert Lewandowski has a habit of making art out of football Two weeks ago he turned a cold wet night in Freiburg in to a stage for some gamewinning magic Hes done it a number of times for Bayern Munich and this weekendswonderful chipped finish to take the lead against Schalke was no exception However the Polish internationals talent has also underlined a problem with Bayern this seasonnobody else really seems up to the task of helping him win games Lewandowski currently has 15 league goals The next man on the goalscoring charts is the injuryprone Arjen Robben with six and then its defender Joshua Kimmich with four who hasnt scored since October Indeed the team hasnt been playing well at all this season but for large parts of the league campaign the Polish striker has pulled them out of trouble Unfortunately against a stubborn Schalke side that wasnt the case Robert Lewandowski scored his 15th goal of the season against Schalke Leipzig missing key players Although RB Leipzigs strength in depth is undoubtedly one of their key assetsand a large part of their success this season at a certain level you need your very best players for the big games This became abundantly clear in Saturdays clash with Borussia Dortmund when a fluridden Timo Werner made way forDavid Selke who was tasked with leading the line Unfortunately the young striker fell well short of this goal andfound himself back on the bench in the second half Indeed Leipzig were also missing Emil Forsberg Marcel Sabitzer and Diego Demme in a performance that seems to suggest that the key players in this team are exactly that key to any sustained success in the Bundesliga Dortmund struggling up front Dortmund on the other hand are struggling with a completely different problem they have the key players fit and ready but such stars are still struggling to deliver the goods each week Ousmanne Dembeles dribble run and cross for PierreEmerick Aubameyangs opening goal was a thing of beauty but when the euphoria of picking up all three points against Leipzig wears off fans of the club will perhaps wonder why he cant do exactly that from one game to the next Indeed Marco Reus string of misses in the second half highlighted the simple facts Dortmund have scored 13 fewer goals in the league this season than they had done at this point last year Over19 games its easy to imagine just how many more points Thomas Tuchels side would be sitting on if they could reach thatsame potency in front of goalagain maybe even all eight separating them and Leipzig in second Ousmane Dembele pictured jumping set up the winner with an outstanding run and cross Consistent Frankfurt are Champions League contenders Whilst all the attention has centered around RB Leipzig Hoffenheim and Dortmund Niko Kovac has overseen a quiet revolution in FrankfurtTheir 30 defeat in Leipzig aside where they played with ten men for 87 minutes after Lukas Hradeckys moment of madness Eintracht have only lost one other Bundesliga game since October to find themselves third Statistically the improvement can be explained by defensive solidity by the end of the Hinrunde the first half ofthe season Frankfurt had conceded 13 goals less than they had at the same stage last season But what cannot be explained in simple mathematics is the change in team spirit since Kovac took charge Kovac is close to sporting director Fredi Bobic and together the two have established a tangible sense of togetherness in the dressing room with Alex Meier telling kicker magazine in November that the team are much more compact and willing to work for one another Goalscoring however remains a sticking point with Frankfurt having found the net less than any other side in the top seven If Kovacs Frankfurt family can find a solution to that as well theres no reason they cant continue to fight for a Champions League place When Schalke conceded a goal within the first ten minutes it looked like their struggles were due to continue in Munich But Naldo center came to the rescue bouncing in a free kick that put Schalke level with the defending Bundesliga champions in the first half Schalkes defense took it from there holding off Bayern to earn a valuable point away from home Adam Szalai left has not done spectacularly well since leaving Mainz in 2013 but he did have a spectacular game off the bench for Hoffenheim The Hungarian forward scored two goals against his former club to top off a fantastic rebound performance for Hoffenheim who lost their first game of the season last week against RB Leipzig It only took 59 seconds until Berlin took the lead against Ingolstadt on Saturday Genki Haraguchi smashed a pass from Salamon Kalou into the back of the net which left Martin Hansen middle left in a state of dismay It was the only goal Hertha needed to secure their first win of 2017 Cologne have lost just once this season when Anthony Modeste has scored His goal the only goal in Colognes 10 win over Wolfsburg came from the penalty spot after the French forward drew a penalty from a misguided dive from Diego Benaglio It was his 15th goal of the season as he continues to move up the goalscoring chart It took 73 minutes for Borussia Mnchengladbach to get their motor running but it roared pretty loud when it kicked into gear Gladbach scored their three goals in 15 minutes at the end of their contest with Freiburg Raffael getting the first Their 30 result was the second time this season in which Gladbach have scored three goals in the second half Kyriakos Papadopoulos second from left may be a defender wearing a strikers number No 9 But he earned his kit number after a gamewinning goal against his former club Bayer Leverkusen from which he is on loan The goal gave Hamburg their fourth win in seven Bundesliga games RB Leipzig shocked Borussia Dortmund in their first ever Bundesliga home game last September with a 10 victory Dortmund did the shocking this time upsetting the secondplaced Red Bulls with a 10 victory PierreEmerick Aubameyang headed in the games only goal his 17th of the season in as many Bundesliga starts Augsburg came from behind twice to secure a thrilling 32 victory over Werder Bremen An entertaining and open game looked to be heading for a draw when Koo equalized with ten minutes to go But Raul Bobadilla pictured left crowned a highlyimpressive individual performance with the winning goal deep into stoppage time Eintracht Frankfurt were made to work very hard for a 20 win over bottomclub Darmstadt in the Hesse derby A secondhalf penalty by Makoto Hasebe pictured finally broke the

internationally successful female conductors explains how working in Germany can be initially frustrating but very rewarding in the long term and why so few German women conductors have emergedThe American Marin Alsop the Mexican Alondra de la Parra the Lithuanian Mirga GrainytTyla and the Estonian Anu Tali have been stirring up excitement in the world of classical music in the past few years But one of the first to crack the glass ceiling in this maledominated profession is the Australian Simone Young Shes been professionally active in Germany for over 30 years including 10 years as General Music Director and Opera Director in Hamburg For the past year and a half shes been a freelance conductor and is in demand worldwide Deutsche Welle DW is soon to start a Germanlanguage television program with cultural and arts content What do you think of that Simone Young Im surprised it doesnt already exist If I find myself in a train in England or America for example and people are speaking German nearby I can never resist the temptation to get involved in the conversation Invariably the internationally mobile Germans have a keen interest in culture As a director of an opera house you may have noticed like I that foreign critics are much kinder to new productions than German critics are What does that say about Germans and their attitude towards the arts It has a lot to do with the fact the arts take a very central position in life in Germany in a way that they dont for example in the English speaking world Here productions are expected to have a political commentary on current situations or otherwise be socially relevant A German critic comes to the performance with the expectation of being challenged and of finding program notes revealingwhat was on the mind of the director I applaud the idea that the arts should say something about humanitys current situation that they remain alive and current and relevant but dislike the kind of intellectual snobbishness that goes with some of this Extrapolating on this and drawing on your experience of working inGerman speaking lands what would you say is the essence of being German I think its changing but something I have always found fascinating about the Germans is that they are very politically conversant I remember that in Australia where I was born you didnt talk about religion or politics in polite company But when I first came to Germany I was delighted and at the same time shocked by how readily my contemporaries would get into heavy conversations about politics or about religion for that matter I eventually realized that the idea of giving voice to your opinion is something that is very actively developed in Germany Now not every opinion is worth listening to And there still is a sense here that everyone says their piece and the one who says it loudest gets listened to But I applaud a society that is as politically aware and as selfcritical as this one This production of Borodins Prince Igor from 2012 falls within Youngs tenure as director of the Hamburg State opera What are the kinds of messages and values that you think should be projected from Germany to the rest of the world Or is there even a need for that I think there is more and more a need for that Lets put it bluntly both with Brexit in the UK and Trump in America I think were moving into a time when countries are becoming very focused on their own needs and desires in a very selfishly inwardlooking way like well deal with the rest of the world later Germany carries with it of course the legacy and the guilt of the 20th century and as such continues to engage with the world outside in a way that acknowledges the debts that contemporary Germany has to the rest of the world Of course I move in liberal circles in that in the operatic the symphonic the arts world in general youre dealing with a generally high level of education and social awareness So I am in a little bit of a bubble Maybe everybodys in a bubble in this increasingly polarized world But with your intense connection to this country do you see yourself in one way or another as a spokesperson or a representative for the German brand or German values Actually there are a number of very fine international Australian artists who really now have a sort of double heritage While never denying our Australianness our musical beings have been very much developed and enriched by our experiences in Germany Im quite honored to be lumped in with and described as a German conductor for example when I go to the States Im an Australian conductor but I have very much a German style and after all the years here have a real affinity with the repertoire in Germany So getting lumped in with German conductors is something I quite like as it describes the kind of conductors whose work I admire too At the New Years Eve concert in Hamburg 2014 How is worklife in your field in Germany different from that in other countries The tradition in Germany is highly professional Everybody is good at what theyre hired to do but they carry no responsibility for the job of anybody else I always say when you come to Germany as an English speaker the first sentence you learn is Es geht nicht Thatcannot be doneAnd the next one you get is Es war ja immer so This is how weve always done it And the third one is Ich bin aber nicht daf��r zustndig Im not responsible for that If you keep asking the questions there was a kind of inevitability that this would one day work through into the echelons of the conductors Sure I still see daytoday ingrained unthinking unconscious sexism but its the same kind that you come across in any country It can be as simple as turning up at a theater asking for the key to the conductors room and being looked at as though youre an alien They might ask Why do you want the key to the conductors room And you know that the thought in their mind is Shes a woman But you have to be pretty small to get too riled up by that sort of thing The interesting thing is that there are very few German women coming through the system My theory on this is that being a foreigner in Germany gives you a license to behave differently than a German woman is expected to behave And having made the effort to come to Germany to pursue your career now this gets into very controversial grounds but you dont take three years off per child to spend at home with your kids In my case if I and my babies were healthy I was back at work eight weeks later Among women in all areas in Germany the current 25 to 35yearolds theres the expectation that they should be able to take 10years out of their careers and then pick up where they left off While that might be possible and an enrichment in some professions the world

environment,Is buying something with the click of a mouse worse for the planet than picking it up off the shelf and taking it home yourself And if it is would it change the way you shoppedWould you avoid shopping online if you thought that would help the environment Thats what Germanys environment minister Barbara Hendricks does She recently told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that she refuses to buy anything over the internet because it results in too much packaging waste But is buying online really more damaging for the environment than heading into a bricksandmortar shop Packaging overkill Hendricks told the newspaper Ordering goods over the internet is a big problem regarding rubbish Also in some cities nowadays more and more food is delivered by ordering online There are also increasing numbers of singleperson households That means that more ready meals and smaller portions are being bought That leads to a lot of packaging waste Shopping online in many countries around the globe is growing fastin the US market analysts have predicted that between 2013 and 2018 online grocery sales alone will grow annually at an average of 211 per cent according to Packaging World Magazine Offline grocery sales are expected to rise by a mere 31 per cent on average annually during the same period Packaging customers want just enough for their product to arrive intact But while consumers may complain about their onlineordered productsarriving wrapped in excessive packaging they dont want their goods to reach them damaged either Some businesses are trying to minimize the environmental footprint by using recyclable materials in their packaging For instance Ecovatives mushroombased packaging made from mycelium the rootlike structure of mushrooms is biodegradable Others including Amazon have started using new boxmaking technology that enables them to customize packaging based on the exact size of the product being shipped helping reduce overpackaging Professor Gerrit Heinemann head of the eWeb Research Center at the Hochschule Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences told DW that while studies show that both online and offline shopping are similar in how ecofriendly they are they showed that buying over the internet has the edge He explained With online shopping the packaging is more environmentallyfriendly than the plastic bags you have in shops More people are switching from shopping high streets to buying online The carbon footprint Transport also has to be factored in when trying to weigh up online and offline shoppings green credentials The carbon footprint generated while shopping can depend a lot on where someone lives what method of transport is used and how close the nearest store is Ashopper in the bikefriendly Netherlands heading to a nearby store will likely yield lower carbon emissions per person than a motoristtravelling halfanhour to a store in the USMidwest where people rely more on their cars Also whether you go shopping alone or with others or buy one item or several can also affect the carbon footprint A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013 found that the further away someone lived from a store and the less efficient the method of transport then the more ecofriendly it would be to buy online The paper found that offline shoppers have a carbon footprint almost twice that of online shoppers who never go inside a physical store Traditional shoppers may make several trips to the store to find out more about the product compare prices and finally buy the product whereas online shoppers can do all of this without leaving the comfort of their homes But carbon can be added onto online purchases in other ways for instance picking up items after a failed delivery or from a clickandcollect point or returning unwanted items Showrooming trying out products in person at a bricksandmortar store before buying online stands out as being a particularly environmentallyunfriendly way of shopping Opting for fast delivery also poses environmental problems sameday delivery and tight delivery slots makeit more difficult for the delivery firms to combine shipments to the same neighborhood That means a larger distance driven per item Shopping in a physical store can mean more ecounfriendly packaging with plastic bags What can consumers and companies do Both online and offline shopping can be done in ecofriendlier ways For buying on the internet consumers should avoid nextday or sameday delivery and where an ecofriendly packaging option exists plump for it wherever possible If consumers need to visit a physical store then coordinating shopping trips with other errands buying in bulk rather just a few items and doing the trip with others will help Cycling or walking to the nearest store is of course going to be better for the environment than driving to a shop just for a carton of milk and if a car is used then buying a lot of stuff at one time will be better than buying single items from an eretailer For their part bricksandmortar stores could provide more information online so that customers make betterinformed purchase decisions and could also encourage customers to pick up their online orders at stores located in dense urban areas Online and offline shopping are similar on ecofriendliness but online has the edge Professor Heinemann told DW that improving efficiency on the socalled last mile the point of delivery to the household could boost online shoppings green credentials The question is why do we have so many delivery services such as DHL UPS etc which all deliver small amounts rather than bundling themhe said Amazon is already preparing hubs they have just announced they will build their own airport so they will take over their own deliveries and will be able to bundle themIn California there are already alot of pickup stationswhere you can pick up food In universities you can pick up booksfrom Amazon Professor Heinemann also recommended that customers change their buying behavior The biggest part of retail is food and the average purchasein Germanyisonly11 eurohe told DW saying that if people bought double as much each time they went shopping it would mean 50 per cent less drives to the store andthatwouldhave the biggest impact on the environment But ultimately rather than impulsebuying thinkingabout whether you really need the product at all could prove the most environmentallyfriendly stepof all

290,2017/2/3,http://www.dw.com/en/howgreenami-is-a-life-without-palm-oil-possible/a-37398114?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf,HowGreenAmI Is a life without palm oil possible,Palm oil is practically everywhere whether it be food cosmetics or gasoline And it is not always easy to identify So I decided to understand this ubiquitous stuff better Turns out I was naiveIn the beginning I have to admit my approach to the subject was naive Clearly palm oil is something Ive heard of before I said its a product of the oil palm tree Perhaps it is similar to coconut fat maybe olive oil its most likely used for cooking And I assumed that I would learn a lot about this fat relatively quickly Boy I was wrong Avoiding it would be quite a challenge And that was exactly my task A few days later I had read a few articles scanned websites of environmental organizations and watched YouTube videos on the subject and was quite surprised by what I had found What had I gotten into The stuff was everywhere In food Not only in Nutella but also in pretzels soup chocolate biscuits muesli or margarine Cosmetics were also full of it And because palm oil is often used in animal feed every sausage I would buy was probably at least indirectly a palm oil product And what about gasoline I had assumed that it contained mainly rape oil but no most of it is palm oil I need someone to help me understand this oily business I thought To make things even more complicated I found out that theres something called green palm oil a certified perhaps sustainable variant of palm oil Would that be the solution Could I use that without remorse Obviously not several sources stated For green is often nothing more than a smoke screen to cover up environmental destruction Because for palm oil rainforest is cut down on a huge scale to make way for monocultures which can meet the huge demand worldwide Huge of course because palm oil is in everything Monday I started to turn my kitchen and bathroom upside down I wanted to understand how bad my behavior really was But its actually impossible to study the list of ingredients of each and every product I have at home What I understood was that companies rarely use the term palm oil Instead they use technical terms or complicated names for something that could be anything But palm oil In the best case it said that some vegetable fats were included Then however I struck lucky While reading about palm oil I came across an app that might help I hoped Codecheck If you use this app to scan the barcodes of products it spits out all sorts of information on ingredients including palm oil Tuesday The core of the Codecheck app is a database which is continually updated by the apps users but also with data coming from environmental groups Franziska Grammes of Codecheck explained to me In addition I learned how the rating system works which allows the user to see if a particular product is good for them or not To my surprise I found almost no food product in my household containing palm oil However it was quite common in our cosmetics Codecheck also distinguishes between good and bad palm oil Good means certified This certification is the main contentious issue in the discussion about palm oil There are different ways to assess palm oil all of which want to prove that the oil is produced sustainably However there is probably no perfect way to prove sustainability because too many parameters have an impact on production Is the palm oil produced in a monoculture or does the rain forest remain untouched Which fertilizers are used to which extent Are pesticides used Do different production standards apply to different markets And what are farmers getting out of it Can they make a living growing this crop The best known and most controversial approach is certification according to the RSPO the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil which was launched by the conservation group WWF Most of the main players in the market including supermarket chains use this certification process Palm oil which has been certified according to the RSPO is supposed to fulfill certain conditions says the WWF Wednesday Critics however see the requirements as too lax The system isnt perfect yet the WWFs Ilka Peterson admits during our conversation But as the organisations palm oil expert she says the certification standard is an important step to build upon The demand for palm oil has doubled over the past ten years One in two products in an average German supermarket contain the oil And Germany and Europe are not even the main markets India and Indonesia consume the most palm oil per year 104 and 91 million tons respectively The EU as a whole uses less than 65 million tons But wouldnt it be possible to replace palm oil in Europe with another native oil I asked It is not that easy Ilka Peterson said We just do not have enough space here Thursday This is a statement that Sven Selbert simply cant subscribe to The expert for tropical forests works for the conservation group Robin Wood He has a clear idea of how a switch to rape could work The crux is the massive use of fertilizers in the cultivation of oil palm trees he says Without them the high yield of four tons per hectare wouldnt be possible and the yield shrinks to the level of rape This in turn would make the switch to rape potentially viable In addition land has to be freed up And this could be done if we finally stopped burning precious oil for fuel For me there is no issue when it comes to palm oil in gasoline The simple reason is I barely drive I can simply choose not to consume palm oil as gasoline But many others do And driving is responsible for a large if not the largest chunk of palm oil consumption in Europe With that in mind it seems impossible to produce all the oil we need in a way that can be certified as sustainable Another problem is the existence of different standards says Robin Wood Standards applied in Europe for example dont automatically apply in other regions of the world Instead the producers make palm oil for the European market sustainably but not for markets in the rest of the world And the rest of the world consumes substantially more palm oil than Europe For my project Robin Wood is the counterpart to the WWF In the end both organizations are pulling together for the greater good to make palm oil more environmentally friendly Even if one organisation criticizes the other both say that it is up to us consumers to become active now If we actively demand alternatives if we start buying palm oilfree products and if we make it clear to producers that we take nature conservation seriously then something can change Friday Next for my experiment Martina Bacher finally gets on board She runs the website Umweltblickde and has put together a shopping guide which gives consumers the power to fight the mainstream by showing them alternatives to palm oil Starting in late 2014 food that contains palm oil needs to say so in Germany says Martina Bacher Cosmetics and cleaning products still dont need to be labelled This is one reason why she developed her list and keeps it uptodate It is supposed to be a kind of map through the jungle of ingredients Our conversation brings my weeklong experiment to a close I have not lived completely without palm oil but I have realized what I am doing what kinds of products I buy and what I have to look out for I have learned that it is sometimes hard to recognize palm oil I have learned that there are certainly efforts to give the soughtafter oil a push towards a more sustainable future Of course this road is long and which way we are headed probably depends too much on the profits that palm oil promises companies today But I also learned that Im doing pretty well right now when it comes to palm oil I rarely use cars I cook my food at home almost every day and know exactly what kind of ingredients I used certainly not palm oil When it comes to cosmetics I always avoid stuff from ordinary drugstores and I eat very little meat But do I live a life without palm oil No I dont But perhaps life does not need to be entirely palm oilfree We as consumers must be aware of the impact our consumption has on nature We must adjust accordingly And if we want less monoculture and less virgin forest to be cleared for palm oil plantations then we should just make sure that we dont buy products that contain palm oil And in doing so the information and impulses that my conversation partners have given can provide some very useful assistance

Europes most successful contemporary artists The documentary Neo Rauch Gefhrten und Begleiter by Nicola Graef offers insights into the life of the mediashy star of the New Leipzig SchoolTelevision journalist and director Nicola Graef accompanied the worldrenowned painter Neo Rauch for three years with her film camera and microphoneto make the film Neo Rauch Gefhrten und Begleiterloosely translated as Neo Rauch Comrade and Companion What she discovered was an extremely modest person who goes to his studio every day at the same time just like a laborer punching the clock Nothing whizzes past him Graef said in an interview with DW You notice that in the way he works He is a very concentrated person who completely focuses on things It doesnt bother him when someone watches him work He has none of the airs some artists have none of the vanities Only when he cant move a heavy canvas will Rauch show his irritation on camera but its shortlived Theres anadmirablecalm about him and does not allow himself to be deterred loyal tohis typical style of socialist realism of the Leipzig School A foreign world His largescale canvases are inhabited by enigmatic characters eerie scenes and dark fantasylike figures He paints whats in his head further develops his idiosyncratic style goes through phases of employing different colors stoically and unwaveringly Rauchs images are enigmatic and unusual Collectors from around the world vie with each other to buy his paintings and his exhibitions are usually soldout events That disconcerts Rauch and thats also what makes him so unbelievably likeable said Graef The whole picture Neo Rauch as a person takes center stage in Graefs documentary as a painter an artist colleague a father the husband of successful painter Rosa Loy as a friend of Harry Lybke the gallery owner who represents him and as a friendly conversation partner to collectors and other art lovers The film takes us on an amazing journey of discovery What characterizes this unique global phenomenon that is Neo Rauch What are the artistic roots of his unconventional painting Why is he so calm and collected despite his international fame For the first time in years Rauch speaks in front of the camera about these topics but also about the wounds and emotional chasms that have preoccupied him all his life Filling the void Neo Rauch was born on April 18 1960 in Leipzig He grew up with his grandparents after losing his parents in a tragic train accident when he was just four weeks old He has felt that void his entire life Graef noted Since he is such an extremely sensitive person all of that emotion is laid bare And you can see that in his pictures The artist studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in his hometown of Leipzig and the school became his artistic homeland As of 1986 he was a master student under and later assistant to Arno Rink Those experiences had a profound effect on the young student Rauch with his wife Rosa Loy also a painter in front of his work Kalimuna His apocalyptically inhabited works made a fast splash in the art world and early on in his career were shown at major museums in Basel Maastricht Munich and New York He became famous quickly his pictures taking their place in private and public collections From 2005 to 2009 he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Leipzig That was an important part of his life that meant a lot to him noted Graef His own cosmos As a painter Rauch maintains the downtoearth manner typical of eastern Germany and stays loyal to his style his friends and his hometown and to gallery owner Harry Lybke who has represented him all these years All of them accept him the way he wants to be He is someone who permeates everything Thats why hes in his own cosmos in himself in his painting in his studio said director Graef reflecting on filming with the artist Thats why you sometimes get the feeling that hes not of this world But maybe thats also why his pictures are so powerful Her documentary gives viewers a glimpse into the world of thought behind Neo Rauchs pictures Its a strong film its images shot with sensitivity and arranged in an entertaining manner It hits movie theaters on March 2 2017 The gallery below revisits some of the most important artists of the LeipzigSchool Neo Rauch 55 is regarded as one of the most important contemporary German painters His

Leipzig art dealer who signed Rauch and other artists after reunification was an important mediator for the new movement Lybke has a colorful history his gallery was under observation by the East German secret Police the much feared Stasi After the fall of the Berlin Wall Leipzig became a center for contemporary art once again Neo Rauch was actually the movements only native East German while Tim Eitel Rosa Loy and David Schnell pictured were West German The name stuck however and New Leipzig School works became immensely popular Tim Eitels figurative paintings hang in many private collections around the world His connection with the New Leipzig School helped him to fame Often based on newspaper clippings or photographs his works comment on our society Arno Rink75 studied at the Leipzig Academy for Visual Arts and he also taught at the academy in the early 1970s His early works are influenced by Picasso Dix and Beckmann and many echo mythical themes Rink is the link between East Germanys Leipzig School and todays New Leipzig School In terms of a specific genre the Leipzig School didnt really exist The name evolved when several painters from Leipzig Bernhard Heisig pictured Wolfgang Mattheuer and Werner T��bke were invited to the documenta 6 exhibition in 1977 These artists had increasingly moved away from Statesanctioned art and socialist realism from the 1960s The trio was labeled the artistic miracle of the East Werner T��bke regarded as a Traditionalist and a critical realist was famous in East Germany for numerous large scale wall paintings His works disappeared after reunification Wolfgang Mattheuer used strong images from ancient mythology in his works that often focused on the fears and desires harbored by his fellow East Germans Like the other Leipzig painters Mattheuer wouldnt be silenced by East German authorities The artists also didnt want to belong to a School and refused the label Leipzig School Author Sabine Oelze db

2020 mission and Chinese space ties,Matthias Maurer is Europes new astronaut He may have to wait five years before he flies but hes the patient sort And that leaves him time to learn Chinese He told DW why space is a unifying forceDeutsche Welle As the first new German astronaut after Alexander Gerst there are going to be comparisons and even here today 222017 at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt you were almost introduced as Gerst How are you going to jump that shadow What do you bring to the table Matthias Maurer Well you said it Alexander Gerst is very well known in Germany hes famous here Thats because he did an outstanding job He flew the 2014 Blue Dot mission And next year he flies again and then itll be as commander of the International Space Station ISS So I believe he did an outstanding job and I want to follow his example But I also want to try to find my own profile And what would that profile be Would it be in the science you do Yes Im very much into science But today is my first day as an astronaut So I will begin with my training and the sharper profile will come later But tell us a bit about your scientific background What is your area of speciality I studied material science engineering in Germany I also studied in the UK in Leeds and in France and Spain So Im a material scientist with a European training as my background Material science focuses on the development of new materials which are the basis of innovation and economic progress Thumbs up for Europes new space trio German Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries Maurer and ESA head Jan Wrner The European Space Agency has named German scientist Matthias Maurer as one of its new astronauts But who is the young spaceman On Thursday Maurer introduces himself at ESAs Space Operations Center 01022017 The Spanish satellite was developed by Germans and launched on a Russian rocket from French Guiana It carried the first implementation of a new satellite platform that Germany hopes to further roll out in coming years 28012017 Believed to have been created by the planets huge mountains and quick winds the 10000kilometerlong gravity wave would be far larger than anything similar recorded in our Solar System so far 17012017 In an interview with Deutsche Welle Director General of the European Space Agency Jan Wrner outlined the agencys plans for Mars the moon and dealing with satellites in deeps space 18012017 After 17 years and numerous setbacks and budget boosts Europes Galileo satellite navigation system has gone live At this point 18 of the planned 30 satellites are already in orbit 15122016 So you do some science up at the ISS you bring it back down to Earth and what should we imagine we might end up having in our pockets at the end of it Make it real for people Well the best example I can give you about a space innovation is this Perhaps you have a mobile phone with a fruit on it Ed We think he means an Apple iPhoneand perhaps the casing is made of glass metal Thats a technical term And metal glasses were actually developed in space on the Space Shuttle in the 1980s NASA patented the procedure and the production method and only now 20 or 30 years later this invention is in our pockets as you said Lets look into the future now because youve spoken a bit about the moon and the plans for a Moon Village What is about the moon that fascinates you The moon is fascinating because its there Everyone knows it and sees it and we can learn so much on the moon We can use the moon as a base for astronomy The moons atmosphere absorbs certain wavelengths that we cannot see on Earth so thats really important But we can also learn about the moon itself The moon is a dead body so we can learn about the history of Earth and how our solar system evolved These are data that scientists need to accurately predict where in the universe we can find live But while you say you wouldnt take a oneway ticket to Mars would you spend an extended period of time on the moon Definitely definitely Now when we travel to the ISS we spend six months there or even 12 months and I believe a similar amount of time on the moon is absolutely feasible So when do you think is the next most realistic opportunity for you to be in space With Gersts mission as ISS Commander in 2018 you probably wont make that because all the seats have been reserved So when is a realistic time Currently we have Thomas Pesquet in space Later in the year we will have another European astronaut Paolo Nespoli flying in 2018 Alexander Gerst and in 2019 its Luca Parmitano On average we have one flight per year So the next free flight is 2020 But there are other astronauts who are looking to take that seat not only me When you say one flight per yearyou mean for European astronauts Yes Its one flight per year on average for European astronauts to the ISS But there are also new opportunities like the Chinese space station which will be ready by 2022 We are working towards a cooperation with the Chinese although that still needs to be established Thats an exciting development isnt it It is absolutely exciting And I think its an excellent way to show how spaceflight actually brings people and the world together Its also a very good thing in politically uncertain times to have spaceflight cooperation because that unites people and always

Orwells 1984 is not the only classic thats celebrating a comeback Hannah Arendts philosophical essay The Origins of Totalitarianism has also spiked in interest recently Heres why its so relevantBorn in Germany to a Jewish family Hannah Arendt 19061975 fled when Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933 She spent time as a stateless refugee in Franceand was deported to an internment camp under the Vichy regime She emigrated to the United States in 1941 later becoming a US citizen Having experienced firsthand the near collapse of an advanced civilization she also became one of the first political theorists to analyze how totalitarian political movements could rise in the early20th century The roots of Nazism and Stalinism are described in her first major book The Origins of Totalitarianism originally published in English in 1951 It has been compulsory reading for many college students ever since but the dense political work of over 500 pages isnt typically a bestseller It has been flying off bookshelves in the US since Trumps inauguration Amazon even briefly ran out of stock this week These new Arendt fans are presumably trying to understand what Trumps presidencycould lead to As it might take a while for readers to get through her heavy essays hereare a few spoilersTrump is not a totalitarian in her understanding he incorporates what she calls elements of totalitarianismRoger Berkowitz professor and head of the Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanity at Bard College in New York explainedin a recent DW interview However strong warning signs shouldnt be ignored addedBerkowitzArendt believed thatone of the core elements of totalitarianism isthat its based in a movement andTrump has explicitly called himself the mouthpiece of a movement Thats a very dangerous position for a politician Populism easy fixes in times of global anxiety Arendts analysis focuses on the events of that periodAlthough her observationsobviously couldnt explain everything abouttodays complex political developments many are still revealing even now asthe rightwing populism thats spreading throughout Europe and the US is reminiscent in different ways of the situation in the 1920s and 30s that allowed the Nazis and Communists to rise Her books provide insight into the mechanisms that allowso many people to readilyaccept lies in times of global uncertainty While major newspapers from The New York Times to The Washington Post are revisiting her writings social media users are widely sharing quotes such as this one Fantastic statements seen astactical cleverness In such a context repeated simplified and false storylines which blamescapegoats and offereasy solutions arepreferred over deeper analysis leading to informed opinions This approach was applied by totalitarian leaders such as Hitler Arendt wrote In this sense Trumps strategyof placing blanket blameMuslims or Mexicans for terrorism crime or unemploymentand claiming that a travel ban or a wall will be an easy solutionis not new According to Arendt totalitarian leaders at the beginning of the 20th century based their propaganda on this assumption Trump has pushed this approach to new extremes even though there are more factcheckers than ever dedicated to exposing his blatantlies the presidentscunning tactic is to discreditthese reports as coming fromthe established dishonest media Meanwhilehis movements beliefs arebacked by widely availablealternative sources The banality of evil In Arendtsreporting on the 1961 trial of one of the major organizers of the Holocaust Adolf Eichmann she famously came up with the phrase the banality of evil to describe her view that evil might not be as radical as one mightexpect The resulting book Eichmann in Jerusalem A Report on the Banality of Evil explains how crimes were committed through people who thoughtlessly obeyed orders to conform to the masses The definition of thoughtlessness that she provided in a work first published in 1958 The Human Condition could just as well have been written to describe President Trumps hastily drawn executive orders and his struggles to justify them Of course such quotes taken out of context may be easy and comforting to share online but they do not reflect the entirety of Arendts ideas Similarly those hoping to find all answers to The Origins of Totalitarianism are bound tobe disappointedArendt didnt pick that title herself her publisher did She believed the world was way too complex and messy to pinpoint the roots of totalitarianism according to Berkowitz While revisiting her works impossibly trying to predict if well be overtaken by new forms of totalitarianism in the future one can also find consolation in another of Arendts observations She considered civil disobedience an essential part of the United States political system andthe countrys strong protest movements currently demonstrate this again As she famously said

seawater seeping into underground fresh water aquifers is slowly increasing soil salinity causing havoc for farming communities living near wetlands rich in biodiversitySenegals Sin�� Saloum Delta is a biodiversity hotspot Just 180 kilometers southeast of Dakar the UNESCO world heritage site covers some 180000 hectares comprising wetlands lakes lagoons and marshes as well as sandy coasts and dunes terrestrial savannah areas and dry open forest Its home to 400 species and plays a vital role in flood control and regulating the distribution of rainwater for the local people and wildlife Lack of fresh water But due to drought climate change and the uncontrolled logging of mangrove forests the grounds salinity has shot up threatening the livelihoods of thousands of people living there One of them is Khadiome Ndongue a resident of Sadio Ba near the west coast town of Foundiougne Every day she draws water from a well in the community vegetable garden The water from the well dug in 1988 has gradually turned salty over the last twenty years During the dry season in the wetland along the Saloum river underground fresh water retreats letting seawater in This is known as saltwater intrusion the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers making fresh water sources undrinkable Sadio Ba village has had to abandon rice cultivation because of this salination The salt has caused a lot of damage in the fields The scale of our agriculture is decreasing more and more because we dont use the salted groundshe said Khadiome Ndongue relies on the well for water We can only use the arable land Our yields are low and we have problems feeding families and selling our crops like before Because of the salt weve abandoned the rice fields Instead we grow groundnuts maize and milletsaid Ndongue A few years ago a visiting engineer suggested dropping bags of rice and millet husks a fine inedible powder residue made from pounding grain into the well in order to reduce salinity It has worked at least in the contained area of the well Djigane Mboup another villager has taken up rearing chickens to make ends meet Salt has really damaged our land Before you could earn 50000 CFA francs 80 euro from your crop Now youll barely make 30000 CFA Its been like that since 1999 or 2000 Last year was bad but this year its even worsehe said The Sin�� Saloum Delta has been identified as the most important place in Senegal and even in West Africa for its population of bird species The goliath heron the great egret and the grey heron are a common sight Uncontrolled logging of mangroves Sey�� advises residents on dealing with salinification But climate change drought and the uncontrolled cutting of mangroves a natural saltwater barrier are increasing the salinity of the ground with huge impacts on the deltas unique biosphere says Ball�� Seye project manager at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN Mangrove forests help stop the advancement of salinisation in the crop fieldssaid Seye Now all these mangroves are just relics destroyed The result is that theres a strong advance of salinisation in the fields and especially pastoral zones No grass grows on this land so you can imagine the difficulties herders will have in a few yearshe said To improve environmental conditions the IUCN launched three pilot initiatives under the Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure and Communities EPIC project in six villages in Senegal The first initiative was to develop ways to regulate the exploitation of forestry and fisheries The second was to construct antisalt barriers with local materials and lastly to restore 90 hectares of forest to improve soil quality Sadio Ba residents have built antisalt barriers to retain humidity and keep salt water off the land A new village forest Villagers were trained to grow a nursery of forestry species that can resist increased salt levels in the soil In Sadio Ba village 100 square metres of land have been fenced off so that trees can be planted and will serve as a managed forest area Here the major difficulty for women is access to firewood If theres a village forest set up with rules it will enable women in the long term and in the medium term to have wood for fuel for their consumption and to replant at the same timesaid Seye Around the world wetlands continue to be drained and reclaimed for farming as they are seen as a barrier to agriculture According to the Ramsar Convention while there is a need for more food production from land the conversion of wetlands has far reaching impacts on their own ecosystem and communities living off the ecosystem wetlands provide World Wetlands Day is celebrated every year on 2 February It marks the day the Convention on Wetlands was adopted in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar This years the theme is Wetlands for Disaster Risk Reduction highlighting the vital roles healthy wetlands play in reducing the impacts of extreme events like floods

recover from human engineering,The Rhine River once curled and turned flooding and receding to support a rich mosaic of forests meadows and marshes Straightening the river out has been disastrous for its wetlandsIts a leisurely 9kilometer 56milebike ride from the center of Karlsruhe in southwestern Germany to Rappenwrt where a narrow sliver of translucent green wetland lies nestled between the Rhine River and a raised earth embankment Its an original meander bed from when the Rhine still flowed in its natural course It flowed in here in a giant loop says Andreas Wolf a biologist and head of the Nature Conservation Center KarlsruheRappenwrt as he walks along the edge of the wetland crunching over stones shells and patches of ice Now in midwinter the meanders muddy bank is edged with bulbous canary grass and sedges fallen tree trunks full of woodpecker holes and bare straggly trees But its these unspectacularlooking trees Wolf is excited about Woodpecker holes hint at some of the life supported here even in the depths of winter This is a white willow forest a softwood forest Its an area that is often flooded and the white willow can withstand up to 300 days a year with its feet in water he explains pointing to wide crowns which will burst into shimmering pale green foliage in spring A number of thin saplings dot the bank a great sign says Wolf that regular flooding is sweeping away undergrowth and bringing in the new sediment that white willows needto germinate On the opposite side of the wetland its a different story In a copse of mature white willows some around 20 meters high and 100 years old theres not a sapling in sight When these trees fall down thats it Wolf sighs In principle this wetland is connected to the Rhine but because of the stone groin at the front the current just doesnt flow swiftly to create the flood dynamic needed Fertile floodplains Its the flow and ebb of the floods that made this area so special Up until 200 years ago the Rhine meandered curled and inundated its way from its source in the Swiss Alps all the way to the Dutchcoast where it empties into the North Sea For several hundred kilometers downstream of the Swiss city of Basel the course of the Rhine was particularly unpredictable Here in an area known as the Upper Rhine which runs along the border between France and Germany the river split into countless tributaries that looped through a giant rift valley bound by the Black Forest on one side and Frances Vosgesmountains on the other Swollen by spring snow melts or summer rains the valley could flood up to a width of 40 kilometers at times sweeping away whole villages explains Jost Armbruster an engineer and biologist in the Nature Conservation Unit at the Karlsruhe Regional Council These meandering floodwaters created a complex and rich mosaic of different habitats ranging from open rocky islands formed by gravel swept down from the Alps to low lying swampy areas and the moist softwood forests at Rappenwrt which thrive in the rich silts and clays dumped during a flood The Rhine has undergone extensive correction to accommodate boats With so many diverse conditions in one area the floodplain forests have a rich biodiversity Some 9000 plant species as well as a rich variety of animals birds and insects including 55 different types of dragonfly and 170 types of wild bee are found here Penned in and parched Because of the areas ecological importance in 2008 the Upper Rhine floodplain became one of only ten crossborder sites certified under the international Ramsar wetlands convention But like others in Europe the Upper Rhines floodplain forests are being parched of their vital floodwaters Two hundred years ago this year the ground was broken ona colossal project just five kilometers away fromRappenwrtThe engineer Johann Gottfried Tulla was in charge of the RhineCorrection program which aimed to straighten theRhine and reduce flooding During the past two hundred years the Rhine has been put into a kind of straightjacket its bends have been straightened and groins have been added to increase the water flow for the barges transporting cargo along the river Its banks have been reinforced and its been hemmed in by dikes Its estimated that the area of floodplain between Basel and Karlsruhe has plummeted from 1000 square kilometers to 130 square kilometers a loss of 87 percent Sixty percent of its alluvial forests have already disappeared On both the French and German side of the Rhine there are efforts large and small to improve the conditions of the Upper Rhine As part of a European Unionsponsored LIFE conservation project for example two Rhine branches that had become separated from the Rhine were recently reconnected White willows need sediment left by flooding to germinate Reshaping and reviving The mud and silt that had deposited in them in the last decades could be washed out making the tributary bottoms gravelly again says Armbruster the project manager Certain types of migratory fish such as the salmon and the allis shad a type of herring need these gravel bottoms to spawn Three artificial islands were also built as part of the LIFE project Their gravelly banks are vital feeding and nesting grounds for wading birds such as the ruddy and the little ringed plover which only nest on open ground Projects such as this one which was supported by the EU as well as local and state authorities show a changing awareness of the urgent need to save the remnants of the Rhine wetlands But without regular and extensive flooding both Armbruster and Wolf say there are limits to how much the area can be regenerated In Rappenwrt skaters traverse a frozen tributary thats still separated from the Rhine by an embankment In a few months the waters will fill with migratory birds returning from the south and the white willow forest will be carpeted with wildflowers further reminders of the precious life this river brings

well that was back in the 1970s and it was only found in lab rats so how reliable is that anyway Other than that the line is We dont talk about stuff we dont do Were all natural And I did indeed come across two companies who profess to add no extra sugar One was Natural Foods who rely on sugars already in fruits like dates Natural Foods with no added nonsense Thats no extra natural sugar or artificial sweeteners to you and me Its okay to get a bit of sugar on a daily basis but there is so much added sugar so we dont add anything else said Joost Warbout of Natural Foods Theres a little bit of sugar from the fruit but thats it Its a simple concept If you pick up one of their fruit bars the ingredients will read 51 percent cashews and 49 percent dates Equals 100 percent So it is possible Its cold pressed and because of the fruit it sticks together and because of the nuts it has bite so we dont have to bake it said Warbout Then theres Germanys old establishment baker Brandt They also have a sugarfree product but some sugar arises naturally through the baking process Sometimes just sometimes sugar free actually means sugar free although some sugar may arise through baking The thing is sugarfree for Brandt means not sweet Shtum unless its Stevia But we do still like to eat sweet things And why not Live a little Some will even say our desire for sweet tastes is genetic Zucceroo makes decorative sugar products for things like cakes They only use real sugar The original sugar from sugar beet or cane sugar is what we all know and love Id say that is genetic said Zucceroos Peter Forsch Technical sugars like Stevia and Isomalt may have a place in drinks but we dont love them in food Zucceroos Peter Forsch says our desire for sweet things like sugar real sugar is genetic Stevia is the only artificial sweetener manufacturers seem comfortable talking about Perhaps thats because its plantbased and its kind of a trendy superadditive at the moment Its a lowcalorie sweetener and grows like herbs Just ask the Swiss cough sweetmaker Ricola We use Stevia because its a natural alternative that fits well together with bee balm Stevia tends to have a taste on its own so it doesnt go with every product said Ricolas Luka Eiselin But we use Stevia to be as natural as possible The CocaCola company has apparently found Stevias natural taste an issue The soda giant had to remodel its Coke Zero recipe a few times I chewed on a Stevia leave at the ISM and it tastes a bit herby minty and sweet We use alternative sugars because of the calories in natural sugar and the risk of diabetes but also because sugar is bad for your teeth said Eiselin Sour sideeffects But artificial sweeteners have their own bad sideeffects Stevia is not much different from an artificial sweetener in my opinion said Ulf Herrmann of Frusano It has a bitter aftertaste and I simply dont like it Frusano makes sweets suitable for people with a fructose intolerance a dangerous condition They use glucose syrup Frusanos Ulf Herrmann Sugar alternatives are not always about lower calories but countering a fructose intolerance Most producers who use artificial sweeteners use a mixture Even if you use Stevia usually there are also sugar alcohols like Sorbitol to mask the taste and make the sweetness round Herrmann said Its almost the opposite of clean labeling You add more and more ingredients to mask the sideeffects of the one and then another to mask thatLabeling is clearly an issue with sweeteners and more so the extent to which we the consumers understand or even read it For instance did you know that some artificial sweeteners have a laxative effect They can cause bloating and intestinal gas Theres a new EU law that says you have to write that on packaging said Herrmann The wording is something like If consumed in large quantities may cause diarrhea But it always does if you consume a lot First the sugars then the gelatin Katjes has kickstarted a new trend vegetarian sweets avoid animalbased gelling agents One of my next stops at the ISM was Dallmanns a German company best known for its sage cough sweets I asked what they used in their sugarfree product real sugar or sweeteners Ricola I said uses Stevia now The dapper Dallmanns salesman Herr Lippmann in his fake apothecary lab coat looked confused Then he told me Dallmanns uses a mixture of Sucralose and Isomalt But he seemed distracted and mainly concerned with pointing me back to his competitor Ricola whose website showed they also use Aspartame The fact is Aspartame and other artificial sweeteners like Acesulfame potassium Sucralose and sugar alcohols like Isomalt are approved for use in foods in the European Union and the United States just to mention two major markets But the complete list of substances approved for use in food varies from region to region Aspartame like many other types of artificial sweeteners is hundreds of times more potent than natural sugar So you should always check the label on sugarfree products and if youre unsure what the Enumbers like E 954 Saccharin or E 951 Aspartame denote dig deeper online Also check recommendations for Acceptable Daily IntakeADI On my way out of the ISM I headed back to the Ricola stand to ask them about Aspartame Eiselin had left so I had the pleasure of meeting the companys young head Felix Richterich Only as soon as I mentioned Aspartame he no longer wanted to talk and insisted I contact Eiselin I have yet to hear back Please note This article was originally published on February 1 2017 At thetime of publication Ricola had yet to reply to our request for comment on its use of Aspartame Since then we have received an email from Lukas Eiselin Here is an unedited relevant part of his response When Ricola launched the first sugar free herb drops in the 80ies sic aspartame was the stateoftheart sweetener for toothfriendly and lowcalorie sweets Although certain studies do raise questions to its safety independent organizations such as the Joint FAOWHO Expert Committee on Food Additives JECFA as well as the European Food Safety Authority EFSA have tested the safety of aspartame and confirm that it is safe for consumption These additional paragraphs were added to this article on February 3 2017

off the Mesopotamian Marshes Saddam Hussein once sought to destroy With them rich ecosystems and the unique Marsh Arab culture would be lostAli 13 looks at the buffalo lying next to him in the straw He affectionately calls it the baby The animal is only two days old andits birth was a relief for Alis familyHere in Iraqs Mesopotamian Marshes buffaloes are often the only capital and wealth A year ago Alis family lost half its buffaloes toa severe drought Most inhabitants of the marshes were similarly affected Thewetlandswhich some describe as the cradle of civilization are located in southern Iraq where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet and divide into dozens of channels before flowinginto the Persian Gulf They are an oasis in the middle of the desert a biodiverseGarden of Eden and home to the Marsh Arabs whose unique culture is perfectedly adapted to their environment Or at least they used to be before Saddam Hussein drained them in early 1990s to punish tribesmen there who backed a Shiite uprising against the Baath regime That paradise which once encompassed over 20000 square kilometers became a hell a desert filled with mines The rich wildlife disappeared and locals were forced to leave Reviving Eden In total half a million people were displaced as a result of what the United Nations in 2001 called a major ecological disaster broadly comparable in extent and rapidity to the drying of the Aral Sea In 2003 when Saddam Husseins regime fell following the USled invasion of Iraq the Marsh Arabsreturned homeand destroyed the dikes that blocked the rivers There was no plan to restore the marshes recalls local engineer Jasim alAsadi who was among the first to hack into the embankments built by Saddam Hussein The locals took the initiative because this marsh is their life Soon water flowed back into the marshes This could have marked a rarehappy ending for postinvasionIraq But today the marshes are again at risk and some fear theycould disappearfor good The marshes are only half their former size and pickups now drive where once there was water Too salty for life There is a big problem with the water both in terms of quantity and quality explains alAsadi who is also the local managing director of Nature Iraq a nongovernmental organization working on the marshes Climate changepoor usage and distribution of water in Iraqand above all dams upriver have dramatically reduced the volume of water flowing into the wetlands The marshes are about half the sizethey used to be And the water is too salty With reduced water flow rising temperatures and evaporation as well assaltwater intrusion from the Gulf salinity levels have rocketed Before Saddam drained the marshes the salinity level wasnt more than 200 ppm parts per million says alAsadi who remembers how the Marsh Arabs used to drink it Average salinity is currently around 2500 ppm But it sometimes reaches 7000 ppm and in 2015 it reached 20000 ppm in some parts of the marshes The buffaloes would drink the water and die They would poison themselves remembers Sayeed Ali Murad 29 a buffalo breeder living deep in the marshes The reeds died all the plants died He lost more than 15 animals Water as a weapon Iraqs political and security situation has only made things worse since theIslamic State IS organization took control of dams on the Euphrates in Ramadi and Fallujah In June 2015 ISclosed the Ramadi dam gates lowering the riverswater levels IS has lost control of Ramadi and Fallujahbut still holds Syrias largest dam the Tabqa dam on the Euphrates All this makes survival in the wetlands harder But so farSayeed Ali stays We are so happy here in nature Just now the situation is better he explains The water is okay at the momentbut in a few months we will probably suffer from the lack of it If the water decreases again he admits he will probably have to leave Sayeed Ali Murad says if things get any worse he will have to leave Indeed a new threat is emerging this time from Turkey The Ilisu Dam a contentious hydroelectric dam on the Tigris River could start operation by the end of 2017 and would further reduce the water flow Turkey Syria and Iraq have agreements for sharing water resources but Turkey doesnt respect them says alAsadi Ankaras control of the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers has long been criticized in the Middle East with some blaming Turkishwater policy on shortages that have fed conflict and instabilityin Syria and Iraq Who cares about a marsh In todays chaotic Iraq with its internal political crisis and rampant corruption saving the natural wonder of theMesopotamian Marshes just isnt high on the national agenda The country allocates most of its water to wasteful intensive irrigation practices prioritizing agriculture over conservation In July 2016 the Mesopotamian Marshes were added to Unescos World Heritage list as a refuge of biodiversity Many Marsh Arabs doubt the impact of thisgesture Butactivist Toon Bijnens thinks it is more than symbolic A member of the Iraqi Civil Society Solidarity Initiative Bijnens says the inclusion of the marshes in the list sets priorities straight and could push Iraqi authorities to take action to protect the marshes Now that the marshes are world heritage the Iraqi government will have to develop a comprehensive water distribution plan which takes into account not only agricultural production but also sustainability of the marshes

pull out of Paris climate agreement in days,Ahead of the confirmation hearing of climate skeptic Scott Pruitt President Trumps nominee to head the EPA former aide Myron Ebell says its only a matter of time until the US leaves the climate agreementThe former head of President Donald Trumps transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency EPA has said it is only a matter of time before the president pulls America out of the Paris climate agreement and that an executive order on the issue could come within days Myron Ebell said President Trump was determined to undo policies implemented by Barack Obama to reduce greenhouse gas emissions I expect Donald Trump to be very assiduous in keeping his promises despite all of the flack he is going to get from his opponents he told the media at a briefing in London on Monday He was speaking at an event organized by The Global Warming Policy Foundation GWPF the main group advocating climate change skepticism in the United Kingdom Speaking in London Ebell also called the environmental movement the greatest threat to freedom and prosperity in the modern world Ebell a longstanding climate change denier said the United States would clearly change its course on climate policy under the new administration Multiple ways to pull out Ebell worked for Trump until his inauguration on January 20 He sees himself as an enemy of climate change alarmism and does not accept that carbon dioxide is affecting the Earths climate He told the gathering the president could pull the US out of the Paris Agreement at short notice He could do it by executive order tomorrow or he could wait and do it as part of a larger package There are multiple ways and I have no idea of the timing Ebell said Wednesday 01022017 sees the confirmation hearing of President Trumps nominee to head the EPA Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt Critics are concerned because Pruitt also denies climate change and has engaged in major lawsuits against antipollution regulations governed by the EPA This includes the Clean Power Plan which was the key element of the Obama administrations emissions reduction program The clean power plan aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants Fossil fuel chief as climate negotiator Rex Tillerson a former ExxonMobil chief executive nominated by Trump as Secretary of State indicated during his recent Senate hearing that the US might remain in global climate negotiations which are being coordinated by the United Nations In response to a question about the Paris Agreement he said I think its 190 countries have signed on Were better served by being at that table than by leaving that table Yet apart from indicating it might be better to stay in the negotiations Tillerson played down climate change considerably Christina Deconcini Director of Government Affairs at the World Resources Institute told DW He misstated and understated the scientific evidence around climate change and what is happening ExxonMobil is accused of having covered up evidence of climate change in its own research for decades As climate deniers are poised to serve in prominent positions of Trumps administration environmentalists have taken to the streets amid worries they could roll back environmental protections Trump himself who initially called climate change a hoax eventually conceded some connectivity between humans and climate change and has now said he is keeping an open mind on the issue Pruitt is poised to become the head of the Environmental Protection Agency an agency he repeatedly sued since becoming Oklahoma Attorney General in 2011 He opposes the Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon emissions He has also blocked implementation of the Clean Water Rule which expanded protection for bodies of water and requires polluters to clean up wastewater Secretary of State nominee Tillerson worked for petroleum giant ExxonMobil for more than 40 years During his confirmation hearing when pressed he acknowledged climate change risks He said the increase in greenhouse gases is having an effect but added our ability to predict that effect is very limited ExxonMobil is accused of covering up climate research over several decades Environmentalists are concerned that as Secretary of Energy the former Texas governor will boost oil and gas rather than focusing on renewables In the past Perry said he intended to axe the whole energy department He has called global warming a contrived phony mess Hes likely to support the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline However Texas did increase wind power production under Perry Zinke an exNavy SEAL commander from Montana keeps changing his position on climate change Initially in favor of climate protection he later denied it even exists At his confirmation hearing he told Senate I dont believe its a hoax As head of the Interior Department he would oversee about a fifth of all US land and make decisions about coal mining and drilling for oil and gas Author Sarah Steffen From rhetoric to action Ebell told the press in London he assumed the president would overrule Tillerson on any dispute over climate policy However President Trumps recent assertion that he would give his secretary of defense James Mattis the final say in a dispute over policy on torture could indicate that he may allow his cabinet to make decisions that are not necessarily in line with his own rhetoric President Trump has already removed the climate change page from the White House website revived two controversial oil pipelines and put communications restrictions on the EPA and the National Parks Service Although he appears to have moved slightly away from his campaign stance by admitting there is some connectivity between human activity and climate change he has also stated that he will not allow environmental or climate regulations to make US companies uncompetitive There are reasons to think some of the rhetoric might be toned down and different decisions made along the road WRIs Deconcini told DW She says Trump may realize that it is in Americas best interests to remain in the Paris Agreement after all Climate goals still in sight Even if the new administration does roll back the Clean Power Plan Deconcini saysother developments could mean the US could still achieve its climate targets of reducing 2005 emission levels 26 to 28 percent by 2025 Its quite conceivable that under a new administration the states would really up their game Deconcini said She also pointed out the tremendous speed with which renewable energy is advancing and how fast the price of it is coming down Renewable energy has taken on its own momentum and is now among the cheapest forms of energy to develop So its possible through market forces and good state actions and businesses who are not going to stop moving in lowcarbon directions that we will be able to meet those targets Deconcini said she hoped the Presidents background as a businessman would convince him that if the US is to be competitive it must not cede the ground on the clean energy race to other countries Convinced ofclimate impacts She told DW opinion polls showed people in the US are extremely interested in moving to a lowcarbon economy Many polls demonstrate its not the top concern of people in the US but people generally want policymakers to move in that direction The WRI believes as climate impacts become increasingly evident and costly the pressure to combat climate change will increase Deconcini cites concern over the likely impact of sea level rise in Florida as one example I think that will increase the urgency over time and the amount that elected representatives hear from their constituents about wanting to move towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions Myron Ebell however remains convinced that President Trump thinks global warming is not a crisis and does not require drastic and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions At one point considered to be a pick for heading the EPA Ebell has now returned to his position as Director of Global Warming and International Environmental Policy at the Enterprise Institute an advocacy group based in Washington DC

hamsters in northeastern Frances maize fields into deranged cannibals that devour their own offspring The same crazymaking nutritional deficiency has affected humans in the pastA balanced diet with all the right nutrients isnt important only for humans Its important for wild animals too Its absence can lead to rather horrifying consequences as the example of wild hamsters living in western European farmlands demonstrates The numbers of wild European hamsters Cricetus cricetus have declined by more than 99 percentover recent decades in Belgium the Netherlands and the adjacent German federal state of North RhineWestphalia during recent decades It was already known that ploughing of fields which destroys their underground burrows was part of the reason and pesticide exposure probably another But a group of researchers led by Mathilde Tissier a biologist at the University of Strasbourg in northeastern France wondered if a nutrional imbalance might be part of the reason for the steepdecline too Life in the maize fields Tissier and her colleagues knew that theres little other than maize available for wild hamsters to eat in the industrial maizefield monocultures that have replaced natural ecosystems over huge swathes of Europe to produce raw materials for biofuels as well as fodder for pigs or humans Maize usually called cornin the United States and Canada is a grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10000 years ago It isdescended from a genus of plants in the grass family called Zeaby scientists or teosintein native Mesoamerican languages Num num A balanced diet is important not just for humans The Strasbourg researchers knew that a nutritional deficiency caused by a diet too dominated by maize had caused health problems in human populations in the past From 1735 to 1940 maizebased diets led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people from pellagra a complex disease caused by deficiencies of either tryptophan or vitamin B3 or both Vitamin B3 is also known asniacinand if you look closely at the list of ingredients on a box of processed cereals youre likely to find niacin has been added Thats a direct consequence of the pellagra problems of the past Symptoms of niacin deficiency Pellagra is associated in the medical literature with the three Ds Diarrhea dermatitis and dementia Physiological symptoms included red skin lesions hair loss enlargement and inflammation of the tongue poor coordination peripheral nerve damage and an enlarged weakened heart But pellagra also makes people crazy Prior to developing fullon dementia pellagra sufferers display mental symptoms including heightened aggression irritability restlessness intolerance to sensory stimuli like bright lights or odors insomnia emotional instability and mental confusion Was the same phenomenon pellagra and its raft of symptoms affecting wild European hamsters whose diet was too maizedominated Tissier decided to find out by feeding groups of hamsters different diets in the laboratory A late 19th century victim of pellagra disease in North Carolina USA A first set of lab experiments with wild specimens compared wheatbased to maizebased diets each with side dishes of clover or worms There was virtually no difference in the number of pups born or the basic nutritional value of the different menus But when it came to survival rates the difference was dramatic About fourfifths of the pups born of mothers feasting on wheatandclover or wheatandworms diets were successfully weaned In stark contrast only five percent of the baby hamsters whose mothers ate maize instead of wheat lived to the end of the weaning period What was most disturbing is how some of them died Their mothers or in some cases their siblings ate them Females stored their pups with their hoards of maize before eating them the scientists reported Pups were still alive at that time The maizefed mothers showed other signs of abnormality they ran in circles climbing and pounding their feeders when scientists entered the room They also had swollen and dark tongues reminiscent of blacktongue syndrome in dogs whose diets are deficient in niacin The maizefed hamsters hadblood so thick it was difficult to draw for samples and a variety of skin or hair abnormalities Maize tasty for humans bad news for hamsters Hamster pellagra After the first round of experiments it seemed likely to Tissier that the hamsters were indeed experiencing their species version of pellagra Improperly cooked maizebased diets have been associated with higher rates of homicide suicide and cannibalism in humans the researchers noted in their final report drawing a clear parallel between cannabalistic hamsters andthe types of craziness observed in 19th centuryhumans afflictedwith pellagra So they reran the same set of dietary experiments with new groups of hamsters with one difference in the second round of experiments they added a group of hamsters whose maizebased diets had been supplemented with added niacin vitamin B3 Sure enough the niacinenriched diet was enough to eliminate the horrific symptoms associated with the maizebased diet None of the niacinsupplemented mothers ate their young The dire consequences of a vitamin B3deficient maize diet the scientists concluded stemmed from a change in the hamsters nervous system that induceddementialike behaviours A normal hamster mother checking on her pups in their underground burrow A wider problem If humans dogs and hamsters are all at risk of forms of pellagra if theyre restricted to excessively maizebased diets the scientists suggested other species of wild animals beyond European hamsters for example other wild rodents may also be at risk of pellagralike diseases and population declines in territories dominated by maize monocultures Knowing that wild animal species that live in modern farmlands already face many threats and that most of them are in danger of extinction it is urgent to restore a diverse range of plants in agriculture schemes the researchers wrote in conclusion Gerard Baumgart President of the Research Centre for Environmental Protection in Alsace is an expert on the European hamster Speaking to AFP on Friday he agreed with the Strasbourg researchers recommendations Our hamster habitat is collapsing he said Monoculture in agriculture is really bad for biodiversity Now we need to take concrete action Conservation schemes available to support the remaining populations include restoration of diverse natural habitats

bottle of tequila reflect on this phenomenon cocktails would be a lot less interesting without the contributions of tequila batsBats are cemented in the popular imagination as fanged creatures of the night intent on sucking our blood Rarely are they lauded for their role in bringing tequila shots and margaritas to the bars of the world Yet without them this beloved booze from Mexico might not exist These flying mammals and the agave plant from which tequila is derived have coevolved over millions of years The lesser longnosed bat or tequila bat for short flies under the cover of night to feed on the flowering desert plant In exchange for its nectar the bats scatter the agaves seeds and pollen allowing the spiky succulent plant to propagate and thrive in the wild With a range spreading across the American Southwest and much of Mexico the bats are the primary pollinator of agave plants But industrial farming practices in the tequila fields of Mexico disrupted that relationship many years ago putting the tequila sector and the bats at risk The Bat Man of Mexico Tequila bats and agave plants have a mutually beneficial relationship In Mexico around 138 species of bat are known to exist in addition to 180 species of agave plant Mexico has more species of agave than any other country in the world says Rodrigo Medellin a professor of vertebrate biology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico Medellin whose conservation work and lifelong interest in bats has earned him the moniker bat man is concerned about the resilience of both agave and its pollinators As the source of tequila blue agave is one of Mexicos most commercially valuable crops But during the 1990s the monocropping of a single species of the plant led to disaster A fungus chewed through row upon row of agave fields extensively damaging the crop Research suggests overproduction and poor land management practices were to blame Medellin contends that the decline was also hastened by the loss of genetic diversity thereby making the fields vulnerable to epidemics They lose genetic diversity each time they plant with clonal shoots he said Today the vast bulk of the tequila produced in Mexico is the byproduct of cultivars That means the plants are carbon copies of each other selected by growers for their quick growth rate and higher sugar content rather than for their hardiness Once they reach their peak the entire agave crop is harvested before the plants have a chance to flower and go to seed But in doing so largescale producers have removed a major food source from the bats diet while undermining the future of the tequila industry by not allowing for genetic diversity Medellin explained You need to allow a few plants to bloom he said Two visions one goal To bring bats back into the equation conservationist Medellin has joined forces with restaurant and bar owner David Suro who founded the Tequila Interchange Project in 2010 to market and promote sustainable agave spirits While Medellin has been championing conservation efforts in Mexico and abroad David Suro has been tackling the problem from a different angle He formed TIP with the goal of overhauling the dubious reputation tequila has had in the eyes of American consumers A small group of tequila growers in Mexico has agreed to make some of their crop bat friendly As the owner of a Mexican restaurant in Philadelphia he knew his customers regarded tequila as the devils brew because they told him as much To combat this bias he sought out anthropologists and historians to better understand the role agave plants have played in Mexicos history and culture A product of the arid landscape ample sunshine and mestizo society tequila is very emblematic of Mexico Suro said Through his work Suro eventually encountered Medellin After bonding over a shared interest in bats and agave propagation they came up with a model for producing bat friendly tequila The project involves a simple shift in agricultural practices that benefits plant biodiversity and bats By allowing 5 percent of the agave plants to flower about 225 plants per hectare growers extend an invitation to those responsible for maintaining the genetic diversity of agaves the bats according to TIPs website A small group of tequila producers in Jalisco a Mexican state along the Pacific agreed to join the pilot phase of the project allowing a small percentage of their agave crop to go to seed in order to attract tequila bats We are crossing our fingers that the bats will bring what is desperately needed which is genetic strength from wild agaves into the tequila fields Suro said As of December 2016 the organization has produced 265000 bottles of bat friendly tequila intended for sale and distribution in the US with more to follow According to Suro the second stage will involve working with artisans in southern Mexico whose skill for producing agavebased spirits dates back to the Spanish colonial era Changing minds with tequila Bat friendly tequila could get people talking about the benefits of bats say conservationists Rob Mies founder of the Organization for Bat Conservation believes TIP is off to a good start Tequila opens up a door he told DW In short the intoxicating allure of artisanal tequila made by skilled craftspeople is a good conversation starter for the role bats play as insectivores and pollinators in rural economies It also helps that tequila has an outsized reputation for loosening tongues and opening minds among aficionados As the coordinator for research projects that monitor the migration of bats across the United States Canada and Mexico Mies believes the initiative has a built in market Tequila already has legions of fans in America and abroad US residents have a powerful Texassized thirst for tequila consuming approximately 120 million liters per year Bat friendly tequila is a great way to tap into what people already enjoy do and understand and thats margaritas he said

soil and enrich it with much needed minerals But environmentalists are concerned as earthworms have come under threat from intensive use of manure and acidic soilEarthworms it seems are the unsung heroes of our world Labeled slimy and disgusting by many these lowly invertebrates work unseen and underground where they till fertilize and improve soil But environmentalists are concerned that industrial agricultural practices are making life difficult for this surprisingly important animal Intensive use of manure and acidic soil with a pH value below five harm the worm although it remains unclear whether herbicides affect earthworms ability to reproduce Still one thing is for sure the destruction of its habitat every few months with heavy machinery stresses the animal Fewer than 30 earthworms are found per square meter on intensively farmed fields But on organic farms where the fields are rarely ploughed up to 450 worms live in the same area according to the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF Thats bad news according to agronomists and gardeners A thriving earthworm population is an indication of healthy soil And the retreat of the species is so evidentthe WWF has published an Earthworm Manifesto to publicize the faith of these dirtdwellers If earthworms suffer so too does our soil and thereby the basis for agriculture and food supply said Birgit Wilhelm a WWF expert in the farming sector For Wilhelm these wormsare the least appreciated creatures on the planet Diligent workers Earthworms are industrious and irreplaceable in that they tirelessly work to fertilize and aerate soil and in the process help prevent soil erosion Strictly speaking there are 45 species and four categories of worm that carry out a range of tasks explained Professor HeinzChristian Fr��nd an environmental scientist with expertise in soil at the University of Osnabr��ck A healthy soil full of earthworms can absorb up to 150 liters of water per hour Some eat fallen leaves and wood on the soils surface Others gather en masse in compost heaps A third category lives in mineral soil which is derived from minerals or rocks and contains little humus or organic matter The worms replenish the soil with their excrement which contains all the nutrients plants needs to thrive including nitrogen phosphorous and calcium The most wellknown species of worm the common earthworm plays a major role for the farming sector said Fr��nd The animal builds a system of tunnels in which it lives It digs a vertical main entrance from the top layers of the soil until it gets to a damp reliable depth In an enormous show of strength the worm burrows through the earth aerating it so oxygen and plant roots can reach further down This act contributes to soil formation and regeneration and improves its ability to absorb water The common earthworm feasts on rotting bacteriarich plant matter that it finds on the soils surface Therefore its essential that farmers dont harvest right down to soil level but instead leave some remnants Fr��nd said Effects of climate change Droughts are particularly devastating for worm populations If there are too few worms the soil will become dense poorly aerated and wont absorb enough water Soil that contains many earthworms will absorb up to 150 liters of water per hour and square meter said WWFs Wilhelm If the soil has too few worms it will act like a blocked drain Very little will get through That can lead to floods The tiny earthworms carry out important tasks for our soils but the tiny creatures have come under threat Heavy metals such as copper are one of the factors that can reduce earthworm numbers However copper compounds are used mainly by organic farmers particularly in vineyards Wine producers have been using the substance as a fungicide for about 100 years although the European Union has designated it a candidate for substitution compelling member states to seek more favorable alternatives Large amounts of copper can negatively impact an earthworms enzymes It inhibits their growth or they can no longer reproduce properly according to Bernd Hommel an expert in analysis and organic chemistry at the JuliusK��hnInstitute a federal research center for cultivated plants Although the researcher also established that some earthworm species can excrete the absorbed metal Even the agricultural sector has long known that earthworms need to be protected says Hommel Only synthetic pesticides that have been tested in the lab and out in the field for compatibility with earthworms are coming to market he added Future food Still the WWF warns of a dangerous chain reaction for humanity and has called for politics and society to encourage an agricultural sector more focused on soil and humusfriendly farming The goal of the EUs farming policy should be the promotion and maintenance of natural soil fertility said WWFs Wilhelm At a time when development is swallowing up more and more countryside good soil is becoming increasingly important to ensure a secure food supply for the worlds growing population Longterm soil fertility and the ability of farmland to recuperate are under threat and protecting earthworms with their ability to improve soil should be an agricultural goal Research has shown there are solutions Using a soil cover with a catch crop such as grass during winter led to a sharp rise in earthworms Fr��nd said Its a glimmer of hope for these underground dwellers

shut down the National Parks Services official Twitter account last Friday after it retweeted among other things a note that the new governmenthad removed references to climate change from the White House website Specific offices of the National Parks Service which is under the Department of Interior were also targeted by the Trump administration after tweeting facts and information about climate change While some tweets from the Badlands National Park account were deleted rogue actions seem to be spreading to other park service accounts Under a broad call to resist National Parks Service employees have even set up an alternative Twitter account Add to Trumps acts of suppression sweeping executive orders including to fast track development of controversial oil pipelines and build a border wall which may never happen Trump is also reportedly preparing an executive order to cut funding to the United Nations and review multilateral treaties including the Paris Agreement on climate change Taken together this paints a frighteningly undemocratic picture of unilateral control over public institutions In fact the picture it paints is reminiscent of another world power China From authoritarian to totalitarian Information is power and the authoritarianChinese government is notorious for suppressing it This applies to environmental matters as well Recently Chinese authorities told weather forecasters to stop issuing smog alerts The Chinese government also ordered an app that collects air quality information to stop releasing data that exceeds official pollution caps Its

out of control environmental regulations are Make no mistake This is specialinterest politics at its most extreme United States environmental policy under Trump goes beyond Chinas authoritarianism since it doesnt acknowledge indeed is trying to suppress the basic fact that climate change exists If China with its singleparty system is authoritarian Trump with his actions is totalitarian Muzzling public agencies strangling down their funding removing their regulatory authority will benefit only a few already wealthy businessmen At the expense of the people The Environmental Protection Agency

settler homes on private Palestinian land widely condemned as legitimising theft Against all international lawsIsraels land grab law thatretroactively legalises thousands of settlement homes in the occupied West Bank legitimises theft violates international law and ends the prospect of a twostate solution according to politicians legal experts and human rights groups The socalled Regulation Billinstantly drew wide condemnationas it was voted in by members of the Knesset late on Monday with a 60 to 52 majority The law applies to about 4000 settlement homes in the West Bank for which settlers could prove ignorance that they had built on privately owned Palestinian land and had received encouragement from the Israeli state to do so Three Israeli NGOs Peace Now Yesh Din and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and numerous Palestinians said they intend to petition the Supreme Court to cancel the law UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday in a statement This bill is in contravention of international law and will have far reaching legal consequences for Israel The EUs foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement that the bloccondemns the law and urges against its implementationto avoid measures that further raise tensions and endanger the prospects for a peaceful solution to the conflict Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the law was an aggression against the Palestinian people That bill is contrary to international law Abbas said following a meeting with French President Francois Hollande in Paris This is an aggression against our people that we will be opposing in international organisations What we want is peace but what Israel does is to work toward one state based on apartheid Hollande called on Israel to go back on the law saying it would pave the way for an annexation defacto of the occupied territories which would be contrary to the twostate solution Hours before Abbas meeting with Hollande Saeb Erekat secretary general of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation told the Associated Press news agency that the law puts the last nail in the coffin of the twostate solution Calling the move theft Erekat said the ruling showed the Israeli government trying to legalise looting Palestinian land AL JAZEERAS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST MARWAN BISHARA What you have here is a crazy number of settlers in the Knesset Ten percent of the Israeli parliament are settlers indeed the speaker of the Israeli parliament is a settler The settler lobby within the Israeli parliament is quite strong even when they know that what they are doing is unconstitutional and will probably not pass the Supreme Court The idea is that the government gets in on it even if they dont get their way this time they will be compensated if the Supreme Court rejects it All in all there isnt much room for international pressure on Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knows it he knows he has a president in the White House whos going to back him Israel is basically going on a spree to increase the settlements in the West Bank At the end of the day this is a moving explosive situation that I cannot see in any shape or form in the intermediate run is simply going to go by without real major repercussions in Palestine or outside Developing over the last 50 years is a dual system of government one for the Jews in the West Bank and one for the Palestinians There is only one name for that apartheid The Arab League also accused Israel of stealing the land from Palestinians The law in question is only a cover for stealing the land and appropriating the property of Palestinians said the head of the Cairobased organisation Ahmed Aboul Gheit Palestinian owners will be compensated financially or with other land but cannot negotiate their terms The law is a continuation of Israeli policies aimed at eliminating any possibility of a twostate solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state Aboul Gheit said Jordan one of the few Arab states to have diplomatic ties with Israel also denounced what it called a provocative law likely to kill any hope of a twostate solution According to the UN envoy for the Middle East peace process Nickolay Mladenovthe law crosses a very thick red line towards annexation of the occupied West Bank and sets a very dangerous precedent Speaking to the AFP news agency he said This is the first time the Israeli Knesset legislates in the occupied Palestinian lands and particularly on property issues He also raised the possibility the law could open Israel up to potential prosecution at the International Criminal Court a threat Israels own top government lawyer attorney generalAvichai Mandelblithas also warned of Mladenov called for strong international condemnation of the legislation but declined to criticise the US after President Donald Trumps administration refused to comment on it READ MORE Israeli settlement law violates rights and dignity Trump is more sympathetic to Israels settlement policies than previous US presidents the Israeli government has approved plans to build thousands of new homes on occupied territory since the farright leader settled into the White House I think that is a very preliminary statement Mladenov said Obviously they do need to consult this is a new administration that has just come into office and they should be given the time and the space to find their policies White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the US was likely to discuss the law with Netanyahu when the Israeli prime minister visits on February 15 but did not comment further in a press briefing on Tuesday David Harris head of AJC the global Jewish advocacy organisation said that Israels High Court can and should reverse this misguided legislation ahead of Netanyahus meeting with Trump in February That was also the message from Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman who said last week The chance that it will be struck down by the Supreme Court is 100 percent International law considers all settlements to be illegal but Israel distinguishes between those it sanctions and those it does not dubbed outposts A Palestinian Cabinet minister also called on the international community for support Nobody can legalise the theft of the Palestinian lands Building settlements is a crime building settlements is against all international laws said Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Minister Rula Maayaa I think it is time now for the international community to act concretely to stop the Israelis from these crimes Nabil Abu Rdeneh a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the law unacceptable and urged the international community to act immediately This is an escalation that would only lead to more instability and chaos Rdeneh said Palestinians want the occupied West Bank east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip territories Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war for their future state READ MORE Israels settlement bill big step towards annexation The international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to reaching peace Shortly before leaving office US President Barack Obama allowed the UN Security Council to pass a resolution declaring settlements illegal Tobias Ellwood Britains Middle East minister also condemned the land grab bill saying it is of great concern that the bill paves the way for significant growth in settlements deep in the West Bank Yuval Shany aninternational law professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem said the law violates basic rights interferes with property rights and is discriminatory because it regulates only the transfer of land from Palestinians to Jews SourceAl Jazeera and news

324,2017/2/7,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/02/romania-protests-corruption-170207100017012.html,Romania Protest Corruption,On the afternoon of February 5citizens in Bucharest marched simultaneously from several neighbourhoods across the city converging on Piata Victoriei where the government building is located The symbolism of this march was splendid the grassroots coming together from the smallest corners to stand up to a central government perceived as abusive For the past fortnight hundreds of thousands have been demonstrating first weekly then daily across all of Romania against two government proposals that would have seen those guilty of abuse in office pardoned or having their sentence reduced Then on the night of February 4 the SocialDemocratic Party PSD which controls the government had announced tht it would withdraw the executive decree reducing some corruption sentences which had drawn the most public criticism While people gathered in Piata Victoriei and elsewhere celebrated this victory they also knew that the PSD would still try to push ahead with the measures In the most likely scenario the proposed legal changes will be put to vote in a parliament dominated by the PSD The continuation of protests on February 5 despite the governments announcement was meant to show the executive that it was being watched carefully Protests may quiet down over the next days but they will most likely pick up once the laws get close to a parliamentary vote The legal jargon around the two PSD legislative proposals was so complicated that even legal experts were struggling to figure out what was going on But the nuances of the debate were not lost to protesters As some in the crowd started asking for the resignation of the government others immediately pointed out that the government had to stay until it withdrew the executive order and only then resign otherwise the measures would have legal effect This is evidence of the high level of sophistication among protesters many of whom have participated in several waves of demonstrations in Romania since 2012 and become skillful at calling public institutions to account communicating and organising The strength of the protests of the past week cannot be understood without looking back at the past years of social mobilisation in Romania This did not come out of the blue Protest mobilisation coalesced for the first time during antiausterity protests in 2012 but it became really powerful during 2013 when weekly protests were staged across the country to save the village of Rosia Montana from a cyanidebased gold mining project It defeated the PSD government then which emboldened it Street protests stopped for a while but returned whenever there was something at stake fighting deforestation protecting green spaces in cities or changing electoral laws to make space for smaller parties and independents New independent media and local activist groups were born Mass demonstrations happened again after the Colectiv nightclub fire that killed 64 people in Bucharest in 2015 That tragedy revived investigative journalism that revealed criminal flaws in the functioning of the Romanian medical system A few years ago during one of the protests an activist held a banner with the words A quarter of century of solitude Referring to the famous novel of Gabriel Garcia Marquez the protester a historian and activist who had dedicated his adult life to mobilising young people towards civic involvement was possibly reflecting on how daunting the task was Like other postcommunist countries Romanian society was known for its low levels of civic involvement and solidarity Fear of the Securitate the secret police during communism followed by the aggressive individualism of capitalism had left Romanias social fabric in tatters Those speaking about collective political action were seen as freaks But within little more than five years this has changed When the PSD unveiled the corruption laws people knew what they had to do get together in the streets and protest It had become a familiar practice Last weeks protests were the biggest since the fall of communism and participation was diverse across age groups economic class and political values Moral outrage against a government ready to circumvent democratic process to serve its members interests united people At the same time small gestures of solidarity popped up such as restaurants offering free food and warm tea and hotels offering accommodation to those travelling to Bucharest to protest Romanias street protests will not solve the countrys problems A historical photograph from the bloody 1989 anticommunist revolution has been in circulation recently showing a young man holding a sign saying We are here so that our children can be free It was echoed last week by young people the children of the 1989 demonstrators holding banners saying We are still in the streets protesting The postcommunist transition failed in many ways in Romania primarily because poverty levels are still staggering and the lives of working people still precarious The PSDs attack on democratic practices in order to pardon the corrupt indicated another failure even the fundamentals of democracy have been under threat But while a decade ago Romanians would complain that they are a passive society not responding to abuse from the rich and powerful today it is different On February 4 in Bucharest a childrens protest took place in Piata Victoriei with families bringing their youngsters out on to the streets to teach them the value of civic involvement The Romanian state is still failing most of its citizens but something changed Many are ready to do their it to help Authoritarian regimes are rising everywhere in the world not just in postsocialist Eastern Europe where democracies were always thought to be fragile Last week thePSD gave a first sign that it was ready to sacrifice democratic processes for its own interestsand justify it with redistributive measures that are desperately needed OPINION Romania Keep the corrupt in jail where they belong The citizen response this past week has dealt a severe blow to the PSD The party may have thought that winning elections by 45 percent allowed it to do whatever it wanted for the next four years but protesters insisted the election result was not a blank cheque Romanias street protests will not solve the countrys problems Failing public institutions poverty and inequality racism among others are very real problems that need to be addressed by wise policies and the political will to carry them through If they are not dealt with parties like the PSD will always try to exploit those failures for political benefitRomania desperately needs an alternative to the PSD on the left that could tackle these issues effectively The demonstrations show that citizen power can check abuses by the powerful In a world where our tolerance for such abuse seems to be increasing by the day thats an extraordinarily hopeful development Claudia Ciobanu is a Romanian freelance reporter based in Warsaw Her articles have appeared in

multiple launch rockets were fired from areas under Kremlinbacked militant control hit Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine only a day after US President Donald Trump held his first official phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin While some viewed the timing of this attack as a chilling confirmation of the new United States administrations willingness to make deals with Moscow at Ukraines expense neither the motives behind the sudden escalation noritseffect on the current situation are that straightforward There were certainly grounds for concern and the feeling ofangst only strengthened when a Kremlin spokesperson said that the recent escalation in Ukraine proved the need for dialogue between the US and Russia It is implementation of the Minsk Agreement that is required not dialogue This however includes a ceasefire withdrawal of all heavy weaponsand eventually the securing of the RussianUkrainian border But Russia is actively trying get the Minsklinked sanctions lifted without fulfilling the commitments it made The fears of some Ukrainians that the new US administration may be amenable to make deals with Russia that bypass the conditions of the Minsk Agreement are not unfounded Even if we ignore the US intelligence report demonstrating that Russia directly interfered in the US elections to get Trump elected Trumps own statements have given Ukraine reason to fear for the future of US support to Ukraine and its commitment to the sanctions Since Russias invasion and annexation of Crimea Trump has on numerous occasions praised Putin even calling Russias aggression against Ukraine smart During the election campaign he stated that they would be looking into recognising Crimea as a Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Moscow He has even dismissedRussias involvement in the downing of the Malaysian MH17 airliner over militantcontrolled territory in July 2014 despite compelling evidence It was after that disaster that hardhitting sanctions were imposed on Russia and these sanctions were tied to Moscows compliance with the Minsk Agreement Trumps people have been actively meeting with Russians and fuelling Moscows hopes that sanctions will be lifted There is also an ongoing campaignto push the claim that sanctions dont work and that Ukraine may have to give upCrimea in exchange for some kind of a peace deal in Eastern Ukraine The sanctions including those over Crimea are hurting Russia hard and the Kremlin needs them lifted But if it hoped to steer dialogue on to such deals by escalating the conflict its plan may have backfired Avdiivka a strategically important city under Ukrainian control came under attack on January 28 A Bellingcat report has confirmed reports and videos indicating that the intensive shelling of the city was carried out from residential parts of militantcontrolled Donetsk Moscows attempt to blame Ukraine for this escalation was largely rejected by the international community since the scale of the attack and the use of Grad missiles and other heavy artillery makes it inconceivable that this attack was carried out without Moscows approval Andrei Piontkovsky a Russian political analyst suggested that Russian military personnel may have been in charge of the operation Western journalists who visited Avdiivka have also reported evidence of a psychological warfare operation of a sophistication that suggested Russian involvementUkrainian soldiers for example were bombarded with text messages saying Youre just meat to your commanders Another reason for assuming Russian military involvement in this attack is that the the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE officials in Vienna were warned of a likely escalation on January 26 Daniel Baer the former US ambassador to the OSCE recently pointed out that even if fighting is on both sides this is still a situation where Ukraine is the victim and Russia the aggressor Baer however was removed on January 20 and it remains to be seen whether the new US Mission to the OSCE will continue to take a firm stand on this issue This is after all the critical question Whether or not the order came from the Kremlin directly Ukraine is in no doubt that Moscows primary aim remains the same to retain its grip on Ukraine through the debilitating and destabilising effect of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine The socalled Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics are entirely artificial creations propped by Russian money weapons and fighters Real implementation of the Minsk Agreement would almost certainly lead to their collapse The militants themselves have acknowledged having no interest in the Minsk Agreement working READ MORE Losing everything in Avdiivka Russia knows this and does not want to relinquish its control over Ukraine The Russianbacked militants continue to delay releasing hostages and violate ceasefires The White House was very slow in reacting to the new escalation and during his phone conversation with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko Trump only mentioned rather oddly that the US is willing to help restore peace along the border Nonetheless Nikki Haley the new US Ambassador to the UN has come out with a clear statement indicating that there is no change in policy either on Crimea or on the Minsk agreements This leaves Russia with the option of trying to discredit the Minsk agreements inside Ukraine or to prove that Kiev is at fault One motive for the carnage and suffering caused in Avdiivka may have been to convince Ukrainians and perhaps the US that the Minsk accords are not working and should be abandoned If the Trump administration is hoping to come to some kind of arrangement with Putin it would probably want to avoid doing so by lifting sanctions when agreement conditions have not been met and when other countries are standing by them There are certainly voices of disgruntlement inside Ukraine but there is understanding that the removal of sanctions against Russia will encourage its aggression further As political commentator Serhiy Taran warned if Ukraine turns away from the Minsk Agreement there will be no western leverage to put pressure on Russia Moscow may however have made one other miscalculation In 2014 Ukraine was in no state to defend itself properly after four years of the Viktor Yanukovych regime During the latest offensive the country showed its strength There was extraordinarily efficient cooperation between the military government agencies and civilian organisations ensuring that people in the besieged city cut off from electricity and heating had somewhere to go In other cities hundreds waited patiently to donate blood Ukraine is not broken and will defend itself The latest offensive has nonetheless demonstrated how cynically Moscow will use weapons of death and destruction for its own questionable gains This is a lesson the new Trump administration would do well to heed before attempting any

Aviv and a few other capitals in welcoming Donald Trumps presidential administration Although Trump has not yet elaborated on his policy towards Afghanistan his harsh and blunt criticisms of Washingtons ills of theopportunistic and duplicitous USallies and of the US failure to win wars resonate with many Afghans Trump is the fifth US president to deal with Afghanistan as a central foreign policy issue and national security concern For his four predecessors Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan George W Bush and Barack Obama Afghanistan was an inescapable crisis and an inherited challenge The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the terrorist attacks of 911 made the country one of Washingtons foreign policy priorities for nearly four decades Trump has now inherited a 16yearold conflict with direct US military involvement and a political quagmire within a regime it helped install Kabul is paralysed by a stalled political process rampant corruption a resilient terrorist group and Pakistans stubborn obsession with making Afghanistan its strategic depth On his first day of his presidency Trump encouraged US soldiers based in Afghanistan saying Keep fighting Were going to win Were going to winAs a hyper selfconfident businessman with impeccable corporate skill to win in Afghanistan where Obama failed Trump needs to know that he cannot go about business as usual In the coming weeks Trump and his national security team will be reading and listening to many assessments and proposals on the way forward in Afghanistan The new US administration must begin by critically examining Washingtons assumptions approaches and partners in Afghanistan in a broader regional and global context One prevailing assumption in Washington is the perception of the US misplaced priority in promoting nationbuilding in Afghanistan compounded by rampant Afghan corruption OPINION No consensus in Afghanistan on how to deal with Taliban Both Obama and Trump have criticised US involvement in nationbuilding in Afghanistan and promised to end it However neither of them defined or clarified their understanding of nationbuilding This confusion has been exacerbated by Washingtons simplistic and partial understanding of the root causes of corruption in Afghanistan and its denial of western entities having a role in it The massive waste incompetence corruption hypocrisy and unaccountability within western entities are actually significantly underreported The recently released report on the massive 125bn waste in the Pentagon or the leaked information on the monthly payment of 150000 by Ashraf Ghanis election team to influence Washingtons view on fraud during the 2014 Afghan presidential election show that corruption is not exclusively an oriental sin To paraphrase former US Sectary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld the mission no longer determines the coalition in Afghanistan instead the many coalition members determine the mission which results in incoherence and contradictions Afghanistan is the place where Trumps criticism of NATO and European performance are valid The US has two types of European and NATO partners in Afghanistan the reluctant partners and the dubious ones The former are some European allies who would literally not fight after tea time due to the restriction on their combat role the latter are those who systematically undermine US objectives by legitimising the Taliban in the guise of peace talks and shielding Pakistans detrimental policies in Afghanistan To paraphrase former US Sectary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld the mission no longer determines the coalition in Afghanistan instead the many coalition members determine the mission which has resulted in incoherence and contradictions Regional policy and the choice of regional partners is another area where Washington made a huge mistake US policies have been primarily Pakistancentric As early as 2003 Pakistans duplicitous role was recognised by US intelligence and diplomatic stations in the region but Washington chose to ignore their warnings Despite growing evidence of Pakistans systematic support to various terrorist groups and its nuclear proliferation Pakistan was recognised as US major nonNATO ally in 2004 and has received more than 30bn of military and economic assistance since 2002 PDF On the other hand US natural ally in the region India has been constantly discouraged from assuming an active role in stabilising Afghanistan Washingtons wrong assumptions about Afghanistan and its unreliable Afghan partners compounded its other misfortune Washington allowed British colonial thinking Pakistans hegemonic agenda and a number of AfghanAmericans personal and ethnic ambitions to manipulate Washingtons mindset and shape US policies and strategies in Afghanistan These intellectual manipulations and misunderstandings resulted in three principal political and institutional errors One is imposing one of the worlds most rigid centralised political orders on one of the worlds most diverse societies This was followed by the institutionalisation of patronage politics and of political domination enjoyed by selfproclaimed representatives of one ethnic group at the expense of the consolidation of democratic politics Washingtons ambiguous relations with the Taliban was the third mistake Despite Talibans consistent actions and rhetoric confirming they are an integral part of radical Islamist movements the US diplomats and Obama administration treated the Taliban as amisguidedindigenous rural Pashtun group Unlike Syria which has become a land of no options the postTaliban political structure in Afghanistan still enjoys broad domestic regional and international support including bipartisan backing in the US The new US administration has to strengthen the principal foundation of this architecture democratic and inclusive politics regional consensus and longterm international support including US commitment to the AfghanistanUS Bilateral Security Agreement This has to be reinforced by addressing the wrong assumptions of the previous administrations confronting Afghan and regional spoilers and fixing incompetencies in Washington and within the coalition Obamas Afghan policy was premised on the idea of peace through appeasement But the Afghan war can only be won by peace through strength which can only be achieved through a functioning democratic and sovereign political order in Kabul Afghanistan is the place where Islamic radicalism was born and nurtured by the West Saudi Arabia Pakistan and even Maoist China in their ideological and geostrategic competition with the Soviet Union PDF Although the US succeeded in defeating its arch communist rival in Afghanistan in the 1980s it has been struggling to defeat its new global enemy terrorist groups Its victory in Afghanistan will also affect the global struggle against this threat both symbolically and strategically Davood

White,Confessions by Palestinians who have been tortured are regularly accepted by Israeli judges rights groups say By Coercion violence and threats Torture Israelistyle A recentarticle published by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has confirmed the extent to which Shin Bet interrogators subject their prisoners to torture Methods include slapping the head to hurt sensitive organs like the nose ears brow and lips forcing a handcuffed individual to squat against a wall for long periods of time and placing the suspect bent backwards over a chair with his arms and legs cuffed The interrogators accounts echo what Palestinians and Israeli human rights groupshave long documented Prisoners rights NGO Addameer said that such practices are known to be routinely and systematically used against Palestinian detainees Other torture methods used against Palestinians include sleep deprivation and threats against family members an Addameer spokesperson told Al Jazeera READ MORE Palestinians forever changed by Israeli torture Rachel Stroumsa the executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel PCATI said that her NGO was aware of hundreds of complaints and allegations along these lines In addition to interrogation being used to gain information about future acts our experience is that torture is also used to obtain confessions regarding past acts Stroumsa told Al Jazeera In its annualreportlast year Amnesty International found that Israeli forces and Shin Bet personnel had tortured and otherwise illtreated Palestinian detainees including children particularly during arrest and interrogation with methods including beating with batons slapping throttling prolonged shackling stress positions sleep deprivation and threats A representative of Defence for Children International Palestine told Al Jazeera that the groups research had shown that almost twothirds of Palestinian children detained in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces had endured physical violence after their arrest Interrogators use position abuse threats and isolation to coerce confessions from some children and Israeli military court judges seldom exclude these confessions Ayed Abu Qtaish accountability programme director at Defence for Children International Palestine Palestinian children are regularly subjected to coercive and violent interrogation techniques intended to extract confessions said Ayed Abu Qtaish the groups accountability programme director Interrogators use position abuse threats and isolation to coerce confessions from some children and Israeli military court judges seldom exclude these confessions Torture and illtreatment are so rife human rights campaigners say that convictions of Palestinians for security offences are fundamentally unreliable not least because the abuse is part of a wider lack of due process According to one study as many as 91 percent of Palestinian detainees interrogated by the Shin Bet in the occupied West Bankare held incommunicado for either part or all of their interrogation Stroumsa says this practice is an enabling element for torture In the military court system which has a 99 percent conviction rate Palestinians can be held for 60 days without access to a lawyer compared withthe United States where the average length of interrogations producing false confessions is 16 hours As Palestinian children continue to experience systematic illtreatment and denial of due process rights it becomes evident that military courts have no interest in justice Abu Qtaish said In addition to the torture and lack of access to counsel Palestinians are asked to sign confession sheets in Hebrew which they often do not understand All of this creates a coercive environment which results in confessions made under duress Addameer noted A recent example is the case of Mohammad elHalabi a Gazabased employee of World Vision who was charged by Israel with funnelling money to Hamas Halabi who is being tried in a Beer Sheva civilian court has protested his innocence saying that he was tortured by his interrogators These claims were also made by his lawyers who Halabi was prevented from seeing for three weeks after his arrest The new Haaretz report draws attention to a topic that is not often in the limelight In November 2015 a video of the interrogation of 13yearold Ahmad Manasra sparked outrage while Israels appearance at the United Nations Committee Against Torture last May which referred to coerced evidence being used in courts also gained coverage But many other events fly under the radar An academic study published in November 2015 in a peerreviewed medical journal revealed dozens of cases of sexual torture and illtreatment of Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel READ MORE Report details inhuman treatment in Israeli jail Activists on the ground say that an international spotlight on Israels torture practices is urgently needed not least because of the institutionalised nature of the problem Although an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in 1999 prohibited physical means of interrogation Shin Bet agents were effectively given impunity for torture and illtreatment by the socalled necessity defence or ticking bomb exemption According to antitorture campaigners this exemption has served as a green light for torture ever since Since 2001 hundreds of formal complaints have been made against Shin Bet interrogators but not a single criminal investigation has been opened I think international pressure is essential and has on some issues proven its efficacy Stroumsa said It is

leaders condemn bill that legalises nearly 4000 settler homes calling it theft of Palestinian land Amona demolitionsIsrael has passed a controversial bill that retroactively legalises thousands of settler homes built on privately owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank drawing widespread anger by Palestinian leaders and rights groups The Israeli Knesset voted 60 to 52 to approve the contentious bill late on Monday despite warnings by the governments top lawyer who had previously called it unconstitutional Minutes after the vote the Palestine Liberation Organisation PLO slammed the new law as a means to legalise theft of Palestinian land The law demonstrated the Israeli governments will to destroy any chances for a political solution the PLO said in a statement stressing that the Israeli settlement enterprise negates peace and the possibility of the twostate solution The socalled Regulation Bill applies to about 4000 settlement homes in the West Bank for which settlers could prove ignorance that they had built on privately owned land and had received encouragement from the Israeli state to do so The bill is seen as another step towards at least partial annexation of the West Bank and could lead to a host of illegal settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land being legalised retroactively Three Israeli NGOs Peace Now Yesh Din and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel said they intend to petition the Supreme Court to cancel the law This law will make theft an official Israeli policy by retroactively legalising illegal construction on private lands said Anat Ben Nun a spokesman for the antisettlement organisationPeace Now READ MORE Israels settlement bill big step towards annexation International law considers all settlements to be illegal but Israel distinguishes between those it sanctions and those it does not dubbed outposts The bill was a key demand for parts of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus rightwing cabinet including the hardline Jewish Home party which argues thatsettlers would be able to live without fear of being driven from their homes many of which they have lived in for years The governments attorney general however has said that the bill was unconstitutional and would contradict Israels legal obligations under international law Israeli MK Tzipi Livni warned that it would lead Israeli soldiers to the International Criminal Court The bill would apply to 53 other outposts and homes within existing settlements recognised by Israel built on Palestinian land according to Peace Now More than 3800 homes would be legalised the NGO said READ MORE Palestinians decry Israels settlement bill The parliamentary session before the final readings began on Monday afternoon but was adjourned a short while later after all opposition members withdrew their reservations Dov Khenin of the Arab Joint List said the opposition would not cooperate with the bills legislative process accusing its proponents of acting counter to regulations Though passed the bill could still be challenged Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week The chance that it will be struck down by the Supreme Court is 100 percent Al Jazeeras Imran Khan reporting from West Jerusalem said the Palestinian land owners could take their case to the Supreme Court as early as Tuesday The Palestinian Authority says it has to see what happens next and will decide whether they have to go to the ICC or the UN he added Last week a few hundred residents of the Amona outpost in the West Bank were evicted after the Supreme Court ruled that their homes were built on private Palestinian land In parliament on Monday Shuli Mualem of Jewish Home dedicated the law to the people evicted from Amona The lengthy Amona saga including the evictions broadcast live on Israeli television directly inspired the bill Nickolay Mladenov the United Nations envoy for the Middle East peace processsaid on Monday that he was concerned by the recent bill as it would enable the continued use of privately owned Palestinian land for Israeli settlements If adopted into law it will have farreaching legal consequences for Israel and greatly diminish the prospects for ArabIsraeli peace he added Bezalel Smotrich of the Jewish Home party who was one of the forces behind the legislation thanked the American people for electing Donald Trump as president without whom the law would have probably not passed The White Houses immediate response was to refer to its statement last week that said the construction of new settlements may not be helpful in achieving IsraeliPalestinian peace The state department later said The Trump administration will withhold comment on the legislation until the relevant court ruling Since Trumps inauguration Israel has announced more than 6000 new homes in the West Bank including East Jerusalem seen as key parts of any future Palestinian state While Trumps administration last week expressed reservations over Israels settlement expansion it also broke with previous administrations by saying settlements were not an obstacle to peace President Trump hasnt been as strong on condemnation of settlements as previous US administrations Al Jazeeras Khan said With this bill Netanyahu is playing to his domestic audience supporters have been pushing him to go even further He can simply turn around and say I tried my hardest Under the bill Palestinian owners would be financially compensated by Israel but could not sell their land SourceAl Jazeera and news

witnessed thus far What caused the uprising Foreign involvement The situation todayFive years since the conflict began more than 450000 Syrians have been killed in the fighting more than a million injured and over 12 million Syrians half the countrys prewar population have been displaced from their homes In 2011 what became known as the Arab Spring revolts toppled Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak That March peaceful protests erupted in Syria as well after 15 boys were detained and tortured for having written graffiti in support of the Arab Spring One of the boys 13yearold Hamza alKhateeb was killed after having been brutally tortured The Syrian government led by President Bashar alAssad responded to the protests by killing hundreds of demonstrators and imprisoning many more In July 2011 defectors from the military announced the formation of the Free Syrian Army a rebel group aiming to overthrow the government and Syria began to slide into civil war Initially lack of freedoms and economic woes fuelled resentment of the Syrian government and public anger was inflamed by the harsh crackdown on protesters Successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt energised and gave hope to Syrian prodemocracy activists Many Islamist movements were also strongly opposed to the Assads rule In 1982 Bashar alAssads father Hafez ordered a military crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama which killed between 1000040000 people and flattened much of the city Even global warming has been claimed to have played a role in sparking the 2011 uprising A severe drought plagued Syria from 200710 spurring as many as 15 million people to migrate from the countryside into cities which exacerbated poverty and social unrest Although the initial protests were mostly nonsectarian armed conflict led to the emergence of starker sectarian divisions Minority religious groups tend to support the Assad government while the overwhelming majority of opposition fighters are Sunni Muslims Although most Syrians are Sunni Muslims Syrias security establishment has long been dominated by members of the Alawite sect of which Assad is a member The sectarian split is reflected among regional actors stances as well The governments of majorityShia Iran and Iraq support Assad as does Lebanonbased Hezbollah while Sunnimajority states including Turkey Qatar Saudi Arabia and others staunchly support the rebels Foreign backing and open intervention have played a large role in Syrias civil war An international coalition led by the United States has bombedtargets of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL also known as ISIS group since 2014 In September 2015 Russia launched a bombing campaign against what it referred to as terrorist groups in Syria which included ISIL as well as rebel groups backed by western states Russia has also deployed military advisers to shore up Assads defences Several Arab states along with Turkey have provided weapons and materiel to rebel groups in Syria Many of those fighting come from outside Syria The ranks of ISIL include a sizeable number of fighters from around the world Lebanese members of Hezbollah are fighting on the side of Assad as are Iranian and Afghan fighters Although the US has stated its opposition to the Assad government it has hesitated to involve itself deeply in the conflict even after the Assad government allegedly used chemical weapons in 2013 which US President Barack Obama had previously referred to as a red line that would prompt intervention In October 2015 the US scrapped its controversial programme to train Syrian rebels after it was revealed that it had spent 500m but only trained 60 fighters On November 26 the Syrian army launched a military offensive on Aleppo In less than a month Syrian troops with unfettered Russian air support were able to recapture 90 percent of the eastern part of Aleppo On December 13 the Syrian army claimed that 98 percent of east Aleppo was in the hands of Syrian government forces Besides Aleppo the Syrian government currently controls the capital Damascus parts of southern Syria and Deir Az Zor much of the area near the SyrianLebanese border and the northwestern coastal region Rebel groups ISIL and Kurdish forces control the rest of the country Rebel groups continue to jockey against one another for power and frequently fight each other The Free Syrian Army has weakened as the war has progressed while explicitly Islamist groups such as the alNusra Front that has pledged allegiance to alQaeda became empowered Last July alNusra front leaderAbu Mohammed alJolani announced his groups name has also changed to Jabhat Fateh al Sham or The Front for liberation of al Sham In 2013 ISIL emerged in northern and eastern Syria after overrunning large portions of Iraq The group quickly gained international notoriety for its brutal executions and its energetic use of social media Meanwhile Kurdish groups in northern Syria are seeking selfrule in areas under their control This has alarmed Turkeys government which fears its large native Kurdish population may grow more restive and demand greater autonomy as a result Last August Turkish troops and special forces backed by the Free Syria Army launched operation Euphrates Shield against ISIL to liberate the strategic Syrian city of Jarablus on the border with Turkey Euphrates Shield operation is considered to be the first Turkish ground intervention in Syria since the Syrian crisis started in 2011 WATCH Unseen footage takes us into the lives of Syrian rebels The Syrian war is creating profound effects far beyond the countrys borders Lebanon Turkey and Jordan are now housing large and growing numbers of Syrian refugees many of whom have attempted to journey onwards to Europe in search of better conditions Fighting has occasionally spilled over from Syria into Lebanon contributing to the countrys political polarisation Several rounds of peace talks have failed to stop the fighting But with much of the country in ruins millions of Syrians having fled abroad and a population deeply traumatised by war one thing is certain Rebuilding Syria after the war ends will be a lengthy extremely difficult process SourceAljazeera
344,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064830.htm,Brexit uncertainty Its the luck of the Irish,When Eoghan Murphy entered the Irish parliament in 2011 he started writing memos to Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny stressing the importance of a strong relationship with China His views were heard and soon there was a surge in bilateral trade and investments from financial firms like the leasing arms of ICBC China Development Bank and Bank of Communications Huge investments from firms such as Bank of China Aviation and ICBC Leasing made inroads into Dublin From a personal point of view Ive seen our relationship very much a target of engagement in the past six years Murphy says with a confident and satisfied smile sitting in his spacious office at the heart of Dublins Department of Finance Eoghan Murphy Irelands minister of state for financial services believes Ireland could become the new gateway into the European market for Chinese companies after Brexit Cecily Liu China Daily Since becoming Irelands Minister of State for Financial Services in May 2016 Murphy has aggressively pushed forward the China agenda With his help Dublin received a quota for China onshorefinancial investment lodged an application to join the Chinaled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and made highly publicized visits to Beijing Shanghai and Hong Kong Perhaps the timing of his ministerial appointment is fortunate The Brexit referendum made Murphy realize Ireland could become the new gateway into the European market for Chinese firms and lost no time in promoting this message With so much uncertainty in the world at the moment we see ourselves as a rock of certainty and stability says Murphy Citing Chinese President Xi Jinpings recent speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on the benefits of globalization and free trade Murphy stresses that Irelands openness to foreign investment fits exactly into those values We have a probusiness government we want companies to come in and make investments to create jobs Those words bear great similarities to the open for business message that Britains former prime minister David Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne used to strengthen Chinese ties during their time in government But with Cameron and Osborne having left office after the 2016 referendum vote hints of the new British government led by Theresa May somewhat reducing its level of openness emerged when May announced new legal guidelines to closely scrutinize foreign investment in national securityrelated infrastructure Within this context perhaps Murphys message chimes more pleasantly with China For Murphy strengthening Chinese relations is not empty rhetoric as Brexit uncertainties have sent a warning to Ireland about overreliance on the UK as a trade partner and Murphy sees China as an assuring partner in its work to diversify and balance trade Weve had a close relationship with the UK Slowly over time weve exported to new markets and found new opportunities and this process is happening more quickly because of Brexit For instance the sudden devaluation of the pound was a dramatic consequence of Brexitrelated uncertainties already felt by Irish exporters President Xi spoke about commitment to globalization and countries working together to improve the benefits of globalization for their citizens I suppose this leads to greater ambition for Chinese firms overseas and that increases opportunities for a country such as Ireland which has a global outlook He stresses Irelands unique advantage as the only Englishspeaking country in the European Union postBrexit its commonlaw legal systems similarity to the UKs legal framework and its governments openforbusiness attitude all of which are factors making Dublin attractive for Chinese firms who once went big on UK investment as a means of European expansion but who are now adopting a waitandsee attitude while Britain negotiates its exit terms In addition to attracting Chinese investment into Dublin Murphy also holds a vision for Dublin to engage with China through the Belt and Road Initiative financial technology cooperation and educational exchange The Belt and Road Initiative initiated by President Xi Jinping three years ago to strengthen Asian European trade links through infrastructure investment has gained momentum receiving support from more than 100 countries and international organizations more than 40 of which have signed cooperation agreements with China In May Murphy will visit Beijing for the Chinaled Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation where he will explore possibilities for Irelands further participation In addition Murphy is eagerly waiting for the AIIBs approval for Irelands membership which would enable Ireland help fund infrastructure projects in Belt and Road countries and share its own infrastructure development lessons with the AIIB I think the AIIB plays an important role for countries that need infrastructure investment to increase the capacity and scope of their economies we want to bring our knowledge to use in the AIIB whenever we can He stresses that Irelands engagement with AIIB is not entirely centered on self interest and that the potential financial gains are less important than the geopolitical gains There may not be returns for the Irish state in terms of financial returns but therell certainly be a return for helping other economies to increase their scope and improve the standards of living for their people Murphy praises the AIIBs operating model explaining it achieves efficiency quick delivery speeds while maintaining low operating costs Murphy says the infrastructure funding AIIB helps to channel into developing countries is crucial at a time when the global economy is searching for new sources of growth He says Its going to be a whole new source of funding in parts of the world that may not necessarily have the resources The AIIB has come along at an important time to make sure that type of funding can continue and that model can continue As a country that has also developed on the back of heavy infrastructure development Ireland has experience to share with the AIIB such as lessons in publicprivate partnership investment Murphy says Publicprivate partnerships in which initial government investment helps to reduce the risk of the private sectors investment attract a great deal of privatesector investment and are also at the core of AIIBs philosophy In addition Murphy sees great opportunities in broader IrishChinese fintech collaboration explaining that Irelands system of fintech innovation and supply chain could be the fertile soil where Chinese fintech firms strengthen their products and solutions Education is an additional area in which Murphy hopes to further IrishChinese collaboration not least because he personally developed an interest in China through teaching Chinese students English during his university days In the early 2000s Murphy taught English as a foreign language to Chinese and other Asian immigrants to Ireland at the Able Academy in Dublin and developed valuable friendships with his Chinese students whom he describes as especially committed to family culture and creativity It was very much interaction outside the classroom that allowed me to understand the Chinese people Theyd always invite me to cultural festivals films dance music On occasion wed all go out as a group and have food and drink and spend time together and thats how I got a sense of the importance of family in Chinese culture Those fond memories and precious friendships prompted Murphy to take up Mandarin lessons when he attended Kings College London studying for his masters degree although he admits to finding it difficult I quickly failed at Mandarin It was very difficult for me Theres the language the writing the tonal aspects I was trying to continue my relationship with China through language but wasnt able to keep it up Despite not learning Mandarin Murphy has today found not just one but many ways to continue his relationship with China including encouraging educational exchanges between Irish and Chinese universities He says From my visits to the country I have realized China places a strong emphasis on education We do as well We are constantly trying to think of different courses that suit people help them upskill and thats the approach China is taking cecilyliumailchinadailyukcom China Daily European Weekly 01272017 page32

market says its chief Luxury sports car brand McLaren has come a long way from selling its first car in China four years ago to now generating a major chunk of its global sales from the country It is profiting from keen interest shown by Chinas rapidlygrowing community of wealthy consumers The British super sports brand experienced a stellar year in 2016 with a 993 percent increase in global sales to 3286 cars In China alone McLaren sold 228 cars last year a significant addition to the total of 300 it sold in its first three years in China Mike Flewitt chief executive officer of McLaren Automotive feels confident about the companys future in China Provided to China Daily Its an achievement that is a little hard to believe given McLarens China office in Shanghai employs only 10 staff who are mainly in charge of the sales marketing aftersales services and relationship management The company works with a network of 14 Chinese retailers to distribute its cars Affluent Chinese supercar customers appreciate the attributes of the McLaren car and our cars are well suited to this developing market says Mike Flewitt chief executive officer of McLaren Automotive As a result we are very confident about our prospects going forward Recently Flewitt spoke with China Daily about the luxury car makers strategy and business opportunities in China The following are edited excerpts from the interview How would you describe your companys prospects in China given the current economic situation At McLaren Automotive we feel very confident about our future in China We are a relatively new company and we sold our first car in China in September 2013 so went later into the market than most of our competitors We have seen sales of a number of competitors decline In contrast to that in 2015 our sales grew by 56 percent compared with 2014 Awareness of the McLaren brand is developing well through a number of marketing activities including motor shows and retailer activity As a result we are very confident about our prospects going forward What has been your companys biggest achievement in the mainland market In my view setting up a good retailer network in any market especially a growing market like China is vital to the success of any company and is one of our greatest achievements We have worked hard in a very short period of time to find quality retail partners who can represent the McLaren brand well We have 14 retailers across China and these retailers are growing sales dramatically As a relatively new competitor in the marketplace these retailers will be key in developing the awareness and consideration of McLaren in this rapidly developing marketplace and so their achievements will reflect our achievements In your view what is the secret of your businesss success in China Very simply understanding the needs desires and expectations of our customers Only in this way can we deliver products that meet those expectations I and all of my executives frequently meet our customers facetoface at companyorganized events as well as social gatherings to listen and understand exactly what they think about us and want from us What is an example of McLarens customercentric approach in China An example of this was attending the Beijing Autoshow It was only the second time we had displayed cars in Beijing We had an excellent presence at the show and we invited our retailers and customers to our stand to debut the new McLaren 570GT to Asian customers While we were in Beijing we also took the time to have a gala dinner with our affluent customers to show them how grateful we were for their patronage but also to help us understand how we can improve what we do for them We try and have these dinners and social gatherings wherever we are in the world but its especially important in China because the landscape and culture changes so quickly These meetings also help them understand more about who McLaren is so its a mutually beneficial outcome What essential leadership qualities do you consider important when leading your team to grow in the Chinese market We have recruited very successful leaders in China A very clear understanding of the local market requirements is vital as well as the cultural sensitivities and differences between China and other parts of the world In addition as in other parts of the world its key to understand how the affluent classes behave spend their free time and so on Only in this way can we hope to be talking to them in a way that they understand and appreciate and build strong longterm and trusting relationships with customers How does your China market strategy fit in with your work in the AsiaPacific region China is part of our AsiaPacific region and we have populated the leadership roles within that regional team with international people who understand the markets through experience with competitor brands as well as Chinese employees who understand what Chinese buyers think and want This balance of international experience and local knowledge has served us very well and has helped deliver the significant sales growth we are experiencing How do you motivate your international team Different people need different motivation We are still a relatively new and small company so I know most of our employees personally Whenever I travel abroad to events or meetings if possible I try to have a meeting or dinner with the local teams to get understanding and feedback from them on performance and how we can make their lives easier In this way everybody can feel that their ideas are being listened to and each and every one of them is inputting into the future of the company In addition we are fortunate to have a very motivational and passionate brand to work for and the cars that we build are some of the most aspirational products in the world All of our employees feel a tremendous sense of pride and motivation to be working for a globally recognized brand like McLaren This combination makes working for McLaren a very motivational and enjoyable experience What do you think about the Chinese Dream What are the dreams you have for your company in China As a young company I have many dreams and aspirations that I would like our company to fulfill Mainly I would like us to ensure that our potential in this very dynamic and growing market is exceeded We have started well and made some significant developments in a short period of time What are McLarens longterm sales goals in China and globally Globally and in China we have to remain focused on our objectives if our longerterm sales ambitions are going to be achieved I am very confident that we build the best sports cars in the world but our brand has varying levels of awareness across the globe In some markets we have high levels of awareness thanks to an understanding created by our longterm participation in Formula One But in markets where awareness of Formula One and wider motorsport is low as a young company we have to develop that awareness Ive said this before but its a vital ingredient of our future success Customer awareness of McLaren building the worlds best sports cars is how we will fulfill our potential What are your hobbies How do you spend your time outside of work when you are in China As CEO of a young and dynamic company I dont have a huge amount of spare time I try and get as close to as many of our customers as possible and this often entails traveling to or attending events with McLaren customers over the evenings and weekends When Im travelling in China Im keen to understand how we can improve what we do for them When I am at home in the UK and have time I am an avid motor racing fan as you might expect doing the job I do and for a company like McLaren and so I enjoy racing my own historic racing cars whenever I can cecilymailchinadailyukcom China Daily European Weekly 01272017 page31
359,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064815.htm,Chinese law firm Yingke goes beyond routine legal help,Dealing with legal complexities in the UK requires advice on the local culture says company Leading Chinese law firm Yingke is following Chinese companies rapid expansion into the United Kingdoms and European markets providing them with legal guidance and as well as local market advice We go beyond our normal work of just advising clients on law We advise them also on culture and ways of thinking in the market they are expanding into so our role is more encompassing than strictly speaking the lawyers role says Linda Yang global partner and executive chairman of Yingkes global board of directors This is rewarding because we are able to participate in our clients international expansion journey she says Yingke international partners celebrate the 15th anniversary in 2016 in Beijing The Chinese law firm is optimistic about doing more deals in the UK which has become a popular destination for Chinese investors Provided to China Daily Yingke originally established a UK subsidiary in 2010 but its presence has significantly grown since it established an exclusive strategic partnership with Londonbased midmarket corporate firm Memery Crystal in 2015 Its UK subsidiary Yingke UK Consulting is not a direct subsidiary of Yingke Law because Chinese law firms arent allowed to be shareholders of foreign entities although the UK entity is directly controlled by the managing partner of Yingke Law The two law firms have so far collaborated on half a dozen deals ranging from property investment to cross border acquisitions in fields including football software technology and industrial technology although details of the deals are kept confidential Most of those deals represent Chinese outbound investments originating from Yingkes clients in China The deals signed in the UK follow UK local law with Memery Crystal playing a crucial part in seeing the deals through on the ground as well as occasionally proposing local market acquisition targets if their existing UK clients are looking for investors Yang is optimistic about doing more deals in the UK as her team has witnessed more interest from Chinese firms in acquiring UK targets after the June referendum vote when the UK voted to leave the European Union leading to a depreciation of the pound In recent years the UK has become a popular destination for Chinese investors According to a new study released in November 2016 by Cass Business School there were 91 Chinese crossborder MA investments in the UK from January 2012 to June 2016 Popular sectors of these MA activities include football property healthcare and high technology says Yang These deals allow Chinese investors to gain technology and expertise very fast and allow them to quickly internationalize Founded in Beijing in 2001 Yingke has quickly grown to become one of Chinas most famous law firms According to a league table released in September by The American Lawyer magazine Yingke is Chinas largest law firm by headcount and ranked sixth in China by 2015 revenue Its 2015 revenue also represented a 38 percent yearonyear increase according to The American Lawyer Yingke signed a new partnership agreement with the UN Development Program in November focusing on SouthSouth cooperation The agreement made Yingke one of the five founders of the Global Coalition of Think Tank Networks for SouthSouth Cooperation focusing on risk management and research in law regulations and policies Yang says Yingke was selected by the UNDP mainly because of its global network Yang says Yingke maintains an open corporate culture meaning partners can express their own opinions and carry out services in ways they would prefer Another unique characteristic of Yingke is the array of opportunities it offers young lawyers as some of the firms young partners are only in their 30s Yang says this youthful culture keeps the company vibrant As an established firm in China Yingke began its international expansion in 2010 championing a model of forming partnerships with law firms in each of the international jurisdictions it practices in It refers its existing clients hoping to expand overseas to its partner firms abroad and once a deal is done revenue from the legal advice is shared between Yingke and its overseas partner We think this way of expansion is more effective than sending our own teams of lawyers abroad because our partners mature teams allow us to expand quicker globally as a law firm and also because law is such a regulated profession lawyers need to understand local laws and regulations We believe this type of partnership creates the best value for our clients she says Yang says Yingkes grasp on cultural understanding is a big advantage in helping clients secure crossborder deals Cultural differences can be a big setback for major international deals but it only takes a little bit of effort to explain things to our clients and make sure they understand She recalls one incident when a Yingke client was setting up a joint venture with a Western partner The Chinese CEO wanted to show his teams interest and commitment so he made a casual remark as a gesture of friendship that the Chinese side will be the majority partner but the Western firm insisted for this point to appear in the contract The Chinese firm refused to include this point in a contract believing it was only an unofficial friendly remark so the deal was in jeopardy for a long time that is until Yingke stepped in to explain the cultural misunderstanding that the Chinese firm made the comment only as a message of commitment not in a legal sense Examples of such cultural misunderstandings are plenty in Yangs teams daily work she explains For instance Chinese people do not like saying no so they often just say sure while listening to a point their Western partner makes but this does not necessarily mean they agree So its important to really understand what the Chinese company means when they say sure On a more serious note Yang says Yingke firmly believes Chinese companies should seek legal advice throughout the global expansion process instead of relying on legal advice from their joint venture partners in an international market She recalls a client who once expanded into Portugal initially without a legal advisor and did not understand that all legallybinding decisions from board meetings in Portugal must be written in English and Portuguese Its unreliable Portuguese joint venture partner took advantage of local law by translating all decisions favorable for the Portuguese side into Portuguese leaving the decisions favorable for the Chinese side in English The Chinese investor suffered a lot from these legal disadvantages and in the end their Portuguese JV went bankrupt Championing local market understanding with an extensive legal background Yingke now has a global network covering more than 30 countries including the UK Germany Poland Czech Republic Slovakia Hungary Spain Italy Greece and Israel In the UK Yingke chose to partner with Memery Crystal due to similar corporate cultures They are internationalminded and inclusive and keen to take on new challenges Speaking about this openminded attitude Yang remembers when two partners from Memery Crystal visited Shanghai and asked her to take them to a local restaurant to try a famous Shanghai dish called hairy crab they had heard about We were impressed by their willingness to try new things so we took them to a restaurant They tried to eat hairy crab actually but it was very difficult to break the shell and eat it and they ended up making a mess But we were impressed by their ability to try as we know a lot of Westerners would just not bother at all Memery Crystal CEO Nick Davis also speaks fondly about the Yingke partnership Our two companies have a shared focus on serving clients and our teams share a similar outlook Memery Crystal is a company which has a history of serving private entrepreneurs so our corporate culture is very similar to Yingkes Davis says cecilyliumailchinadailyukcom

361,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064812.htm,Measure of change,Nobelwinning economist Robert Engle suggests improvements to capital allocation for fastgrowing SMEs American economist Robert Engle gave Chinese officials some ideas on how to make Chinas financial sector more efficient Engle winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in economics along with British economist Clive Granger was invited to Beijing last week by the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs to give his suggestions on risk management in Chinas capital market because of his expertise in studying volatility Financial institutions should be subjected to regular stress tests to see if they remain solvent enough in the face of an economic downturn The results of such tests should be published publicly and become benchmarks for the performance of banks so that they do a more effective job of choosing where the loans go he says Robert Engle Nobel laureate makes a speech at an economic forum in Nankai University in Tianjin in October 2016 Photos Provided to China Daily Engle and his wife Mary attend the forum at Nankai University where he is an honorary professor I think that many more benefits will come from improving allocation of capital to the fastgrowing SMEs which are also job creators says Engle 75 He and Granger are recognized for developing the groundbreaking statistical model called the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity designed to analyze unpredictable movements in market prices and interest rates The method can also measure systematic risks in financial markets especially on a shortterm basis If you try to predict a year in the future its very complicated If its a day in the future thats not so hard he explains If we talk about risk management for financial applications maybe shorthorizon predictions are enough Engle earned a masters degree in physics before he went on to acquire a PhD in economics from Cornell University in 1969 I decided that I wanted to work on something that more than 10 people in the world will understand he says of the reason behind changing streams in academics While studying economics was at first a slow and painful process Engle believes his background in physics and statistics eventually helped him stand out as an economist Because in physics we do experiments to measure some complicated things and figure out what they really mean Thats the same way we do economic analysis he says A longtime professor of economics Engle now teaches at New York Universitys Stern School of Business where he is the Michael Armellino professor of financial services management Engle paid his first visit to China in 1985 when he was invited to teach an econometrics course at Renmin University of China in Beijing During the sixweek program which was sponsored by the Ford Foundation and Chinas Ministry of Education Engle and two other American teachers taught students from different parts of the country Chinese students were rather quiet back then and he did all sorts of things including giving them small souvenirs to get them to talk As part of the trip Engle toured Shanghai Guilin and Chengdu and visited many tourist sites in the cities China has changed so dramatically in 30 years Thats extraordinary People in Beijing were still wearing oldstyle blue outfits in the 1980s and there were very few cars and everybody was riding a bicycle It was also hard to find people who spoke English and he had to get somebody to write down in Chinese the name of his hotel so that he could tell a taxi driver to take him back Engle says If they Chinese authorities can figure out whats the right thing to do theyll do it And theyve been very good at that he adds Engle who is on an advisory board of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences comes to China more often these days attending conferences and giving talks In 2014 Engle launched a Shanghai branch of the Volatility Institute of the Stern School of Business as part of a New York University initiative there He is director of the institute NYU Shanghai which was established by New York University and East China Normal University is the first SinoUS university campus Operated in close partnership with the Stern School and applying tools such as an awardwinning model to analyze data the Volatility Institute at NYU Shanghai provides financial information and analysis of the markets on its website for economists regulators and even the general public The Shanghai institute has cooperated with the stock exchange and universities in the southern metropolis and has also started an annual conference series that brings experts to discuss Chinas financial system Engle says Despite his busy schedule as a highprofile economist and a regular teaching schedule Engle tries to stick to hobbies like figure skating and dancing But whenever he gets a chance to relax he finds a lot of questions running through his mind I always look for simple answers says Engle who rewards himself with simple pleasures like a cup of coffee every time he figures out an answer liuxiangruichinadailycomcn China Daily European

for success claws her way to online respectability by following loads of chutzpah with growing sophistication During the latest US presidential election most Chinese pundits followed the prognostication of mainstream American media and wrote off Donald Trump as an outlier with more entertainment value than a real chance of winning A notable exception was Luo Yufeng who did not belong to any think tank here in China or Stateside A month before the November election she said based on the Twitter accounts of Trump and Clinton that she followed she sensed more support for Trump On the day of the election she posted an article about a trailer driver she knew which ended up explaining Trumps unexpected victory better than almost all Chineselanguage analysis that surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the event The driver who Luo claims to have known for several years used to make a decent living by hauling big loads across the American continent He could rake in considerable cash during the holiday seasons like Christmas because he was willing to work while others would take the time off for family gatherings But with the inflow of new immigrants his pay flattened out and then started a long decline Now he had to consider quitting the business He legally migrated to the United States a decade ago and his livelihood unlike that of most middleclass American families was threatened by the wave of illegal immigrants under a Democratic administration Luos article did not draw any conclusions She just gave a vivid description of one person and his quandary Luo works in a New York beauty parlor earning a living by clipping nails for customers She is the furthest thing from a talking head in an ivory tower or power center She is plugged in to the grassroots at least the social segment that is her crowd in terms of linguistic preference and social background Back home in China her writing has gained a sizable following A following that used to mock her for her plain looks and ungainly behavior In the past year and half many of her early detractors have publicly apologized for their ugly words of prejudice against her Each of her articles is followed by an endless string of apologies such as this on the iFeng site Sister Phoenix I was one of those who had ruthlessly ridiculed you I didnt know it was a complex thing to evaluate someone I just took the surface for what it is I have since discovered your talent and your insight and your perseverance I have read all your writings And I can say that many of those emptytalking experts are just out there for selfgain Only you have articulated the hardships of people at the bottom of society like us My sincerest apology to you Sister Phoenix or Fengjie is her online moniker patterned on a character in a literary classic For several years it was a name people loved to hate or at least to laugh at A profile in People magazine called her Chinas most hated reality star Indeed there was reason enough to take her as a joke as she was positioning herself as more or less a clown for the purpose of public attention Luo born in 1985 hailed from a poor village in the hinterland She attended college for three years and worked as an elementary school teacher for two years Then she decided to head for the bright lights Moving to Shanghai she found that competition was more fierce in the big city She was working at the checkout counter of a supermarket when she began to use the dating game as her platform for selfpromotion She turned herself into an instant laughing stock when she listed her ideal men who included a couple of Chinese superstars and the US president Her outrageous remarks such as her selfassessment as one with the highest IQ in 300 years and 300 more years from now kept her in the limelight winning her the title worthy of the Nobel prize in chutzpah Coupled with her lack of physical beauty as defined by stars her brazenness stood out glaringly in a culture that traditionally values modesty and selfeffacement Luo did the rounds of the nations reality shows but rarely made it to the finals Just as her 15 minutes of fame seemed to be used up when a report surfaced saying that television shows that included her were considered too vulgar by the regulators and faced a regulatory crackdown she got a visa for the US After a few years as a footnote to the last internet dynasty Luo reappeared this time as a contracted columnist for iFeng a website previously affiliated with the Phoenix television network Surprisingly to many she has mellowed Yes she still throws out the occasional repartee that blends a superiority complex with an inferiority complex But when she uses the form and length of writing traditionally saved for old media her persona emerges with more subtlety and maturity She is able to discuss complicated social political and crosscultural issues with earthy humor and sharp insight Luos observations of American society seen from the ultralow perspective of a wannabe immigrant and the contrast she provides with Chinese society in flux have exalted her to a position rarely achieved by anyone with better education or pedigree She gains a ringside view of the US far from the office towers of prestigious media and relays it to a Chinese public who would never bother with a newspaper let alone its opinion page Maybe Luo had a split personality from the start When she was still playing the dating game some of her poems surfaced revealing a sensitive soul and a writing proficiency on par with professionals But they were lost in the crazy whirlwind she had helped whip up around her Jane Eyre would not have taken this route to fame or fortune but Luo a product of reformera China has even less to fall back on than the character in the Charlotte Bronte novel She may not have clawed her way to middleclass respectability yet but nobody can deny her effort For her latest posting on Jan 12 titled I want your blessings and encouragement she received a tidal wave of empathy and appreciation especially from the huddled masses who used to taunt her Contact the writer at raymondzhouchinadailycomcn China Daily European

366,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064807.htm,China must cut its wasteful ways,Planners look to big data and other solutions to reduce the enormous amount of food being thrown away Aware that onethird of all food produced in the world is thrown away governments institutions and organizations are working on minimizing food waste In China alone enough food is discarded in restaurants annually to feed between 30 million and 50 million people Chinas challenges were highlighted in late November when Cheng Shengkui from the Chinese Academy of Sciences told the Food Waste Forum in Beijing that 17 to 18 million tons of food were wasted in China each year from 2013 to 2015 Cheng and his team from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research surveyed almost 7000 tables and 366 restaurants in Beijing Shanghai and the southwestern cities of Lhasa and Chengdu Cooks prepare food at a restaurant in Chengdu in Southwest Chinas Sichuan province on Sept 8 last year It is estimated that enough food is discarded in restaurants annually in China to feed between 30 million and 50 million people Provided to China Daily The team interviewed hundreds of people collated 7500 questionnaires and weighed 32000 dishes Cheng presented the findings at the seminar hosted by organizations including the United Nations Environment Programme It is no secret that food loss and waste is a big problem says Xie Yuhong deputy secretarygeneral of the AllChina Environment Federation a nongovernmental organization supervised by the Ministry of Environmental Protection during the forum The problems are myriad from the methane gas released by food waste into the atmosphere to the fact that discarded food could help to alleviate poverty One piece of good news is that there are multiple ways to reduce this type of waste says Luca Mantovani a consultant at PDA cademia who specializes in facilities management Big data for example can help cafeterias at large companies cut down on waste Some are tying food production to data from smart cards that employees use to enter buildings In effect cafeteria operators can know almost exactly how many people are in the building and how many will go to eat Big data can also determine what dishes are popular and what dishes are not on given days depending on who is at work There are buildings that go all out says Mantovani The recycling business in China is quite big The food that consumers throw away is at the tail end of a chain of waste that starts much earlier In a 2015 study the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation forum found that 54 percent of waste comes from production handling storage processing and packaging in other words in the supply of food The remaining 46 percent is on the demand side of the equation including distribution and consumption Campaigns are under way to reduce this massive footprint In 2013 for example the United Nations Environment Programme along with partners launched the ThinkEatSave initiative to reduce waste At a more local level the issue is also significant In Hong Kong waste of all types is straining the citys infrastructure to its breaking point Most discarded food in the city ends up in landfills along with other types of municipal solid waste which is general garbage from the domestic commercial and industrial sectors Some 55 million tons of solid waste ended up in Hong Kongs landfills in 2015 with a full third of that being food The numbers have risen every year since 2010 The current practice of disposing of biodegradable food waste at landfills is not sustainable says the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department Reducing food waste disposal at landfills is an important part of the governments plan for waste management Food is the single largest category of waste in Hong Kongs landfills and the amount is growing every year Programs are in place to deal with the problem and the government is working to implement a strategy Our wasteful habits put tremendous pressure on the entire waste chain noted the Hong Kong Environment Bureau which formulates policies to protect the environment and also enforces related legislation in a blueprint for the sustainable use of resources for 2013 to 2022 We have a large waste load Over the years Hong Kong people have become more not less wasteful it says Implemented in 2014 the blueprint called for a reduction of solid waste disposal of 20 percent by this year and 40 percent by 2022 By 2013 the daily per capita rate of municipal solid waste had risen to 127 kilograms from 097 about a decade earlier The numbers continued to rise through 2015 At the same time recycling rates dropped by about a quarter in the decade leading up to 2015 It is a pretty protracted process says Gerald Patchell an associate professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Municipalities in Japan South Korea and North America all move much faster In the United States for example San Francisco processes all of its waste People make excuses for Hong Kong and to a certain extent it is valid about the structure of the city and the environment in a lot of the buildings not having facilities for this type of thing Patchell says Probably the biggest bugbear is this idea that everything is dealt with in Hong Kong In other large cities around the world trash is sent to the outskirts or hinterland Hong Kong does not have a big enough region to do that unless it sends its waste to the Chinese mainland Personal space is also smaller in Hong Kong so not a lot of room exists to store say multiple containers for different types of trash One effective program is run by the Airport Authority Hong Kong the government body which manages the international airport Since 2003 it has been building and expanding the infrastructure to recycle and dispose of food waste which is composted into soil used for landscaping In 2011 the program expanded to collect waste from 17 partners and distribute it to a company that converts it into animal feed A pilot program in 2014 included a shopping mall near the airport Some 1200 tons of food waste were collected from the airport in 2015 That same year 32 tons of surplus food was picked up in Hong Kong by Food Angel a nongovernmental organization and was used to produce 25000 meal boxes for the citys poor The airport program is unique but relatively small compared to the thousands of tons of waste that ends up in Hong Kongs three operating landfills The Hong Kong government aims to develop five to six organic waste treatment facilities that can recycle as much as 1500 tons per day The first of these plants began construction in 2014 and is expected to be commissioned this year It has the capacity to treat as much as 200 tons per day A second plant with a daily capacity of 300 tons is still in the planning stages But the sheer amount of food waste is creating or exacerbating problems in Hong Kong There is simply no space to put all that waste Already the citys three landfills are running out of space and will all be full by 2019 Hong Kong has already closed 13 landfills Joyce Chan is the chief operations officer at the Foodlink Foundation a Hong Kong charity dedicated to reducing food waste She noted that repurposing food to feed those in need would not have an enormous impact on the total amount of food waste that is being disposed into our landfills but it is still necessary especially when there is a social need for goodquality edible food But dealing with the issue will require a holistic approach according to Chan who says the biggest issues relate to the displacement of responsibility We should not assume that food waste is the responsibility of the food industry as it is largely demanddriven says Chan If consumers are more conscious of the amount of food waste they generate and everyone plays a role in minimizing their personal food waste then we can do better as a community For China Daily China Daily European Weekly 01272017 page18
367,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064805.htm,From a young age a ticket to a dream role in paradise,When Ahmed Asim was a boy his career path had already been laid out before him My job is to make people feel at home literally since this has been my home for the past 30 years says Ahmed Asim room director of the St Regis Vommuli hotel in the Maldives Between his generation and that of his parents his country has turned from a gathering of specks in the Indian Ocean to one of the worlds bestknown and most desired escapes Yet for Asim the notion of escape is virtually nonexistent if not laughable For me this only provides an initiation to the outside world as they are coming to us in planeloads His entry into this world came early he says When he was at primary school property owners invited him and his classmates to tour the resort islands where human endeavor tries to emulate natural beauty in creating paradise on Earth sometimes with unintended results Wow was my reaction Asim recalls casting an incredulous look Then I told myself Someday Im going to work here The wideeyed child has given way to a softspoken man with a confident air and in the meantime he has gained a diploma in hospitality and worked as a trainee butler and then as a butler for many years in a number of hotels some of them luxury ones He joined the St Regis at Vommuli as room director in October when preparations were being made for the hotels grand opening Between 50 and 60 percent of our 300strong staff are Maldivians Asim says Quite a few of us including me are in management Spending the bulk of his time in airconditioned rooms or traveling in buggies from villa to villa Asims life is a world apart from that of his parents who have seven children in total Like most Maldivian families of their generation my father made a living out of fishing while my mother did household chores The sea around here is probably the calmest on Earth Ive never heard of anyone who died out fishing in the sea But still the sun and the wind can be unforgiving thats why few young people are involved in fishing today His father usually left home about 530 am and fished for tuna all day before returning in the evening he says Ours was a small boat There were also bigger boats on which one can go out fishing in the sea for weeks at a time But whatever you go out in small or big fishing in the Maldives has to be by pole instead of by net We do angling all the time The fish nets are reserved only for the capture of baitfish fish used as bait when angling Our government has been very aggressive when it comes to environmental protection Thats why we still have what we had 20 or 30 years ago Asked whether angling is a financially viable way of fishing Asim says that on a good day a good angler can catch up to 2000 tuna The fish tend to appear in groups and when you really think about it that kind of catch suggests the fish must be virtually jumping onto the hook if not directly into the boat These days though fishing has decreased compared with 20 years ago Asims parents stopped fishing about 15 years ago and now live in Male the countrys capital The catch apart from fulfilling local needs goes on to the dining tables of tourists At the St Regis amid offerings of caviar lobster truffle foie gras and Kobe beef I discovered a course unpretentiously titled Catch of the day I tried it and did not regret my decision Later as I spent my last day in the Maldives at the Sheraton on Full Moon Island I encountered the same offering and realized that it was a local signature dish Ayyoub Salameh director of culinary service at the St Regis says the hotel buys 600 kilograms of fish each day from local fishermen for the consumption of guests and hotel staff It also buys produce from local farmers I dont think Ill stay in the country for life so Im going to deliver something for it says the master cook a Jordanian who is also creating a garden for local spices and herbs Similar willingness is also expressed by Wong Chiu Man and his wife Maria Warner Wong the architectural duo and Harvard graduates who designed the St Regis at Vommuli The Vommuli House is inspired by the extending roots of banyan trees Warner Wong says The parts were prefabricated and preengineered before being sent to Vommuli for rapid erection with the help of Maldivian workers In this way we have tried to be environmentally friendly while passing on construction skills to locals Once the couple was invited for a drink at a nearby island only to discover that the hostess a Maldivian who had previously worked on the construction site at Vommuli had fashioned her little bar using discarded plywood she had gathered from the St Regis site Wong Chiu Man asked about any misgivings he has about the hotels design said that if he had his chance again he would pay greater heed to any risks such a project posed to the environment The construction of the water villas did cause the bleaching of corals on a scale I hate to see But as tourists pour in wont further stress be put on the countrys unspoiled beauty and fragile ecosystem I dont see that happening Asim says First of all the Maldives is a highend tourist destination as we cater to a niche market This is especially true in our case For the moment the government has adopted a very positive attitude toward developing tourism A college in Male offers a masters degree in hospitality and tourism However he acknowledges that even though tourists started coming to the Maldives in the 1970s it is only in the past five years that the countrys tourism industry has really taken off Asim married with a twoandahalfyearold son sees differences in the ways childhoods were spent before and now For me it was just the sun sand and sea for him its more about colorful toys Because of Asims job he can see his wife and son as often as he would like to Fan Qianyi a Chinese diving coach at Vommuli says this kind of family living arrangement is common among young Maldivians Ive been here for four years but havent seen many Maldivian women Usually men work outside on resort islands while women and children stay behind in whats known as the local islands It reminds me of migrant workers in China certainly not the best solution Twenty years ago when Asim first visited a luxury hotel at a resort he dreamed of being part of what he saw He has higher hopes for his son I wont object if he wants to go into the tourism industry my parents have been very encouraging and all my brothers work in catering but it would be great if he becomes a doctor or a lawyer For some Maldivians a simple life though hard may have started to change along with their longheld sense of contentment But with all the building and opening of luxury hotels is there any talk about possible gentrification the effect of which might be mitigated by the geographical isolation of each island Such an idea has yet to come to the Maldives Asim says China Daily European Weekly 01272017 page16

375,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064793.htm,Ranking Chinas global brand builders,As the Chinese economy continues its transition from lowcost production to highquality premium brands the new year began with the release of the first BrandZ Top 30 Chinese Brand Builders ranking and report earlier this month This report is the result of groundbreaking new research that provides tremendous insight into the brandbuilding progress made by Chinese companies in overseas markets The research methodology focuses on overseas consumers attitudes beliefs and feelings toward Chinese brands Chinese companies and Chinas image have been subjected to considerable investigative research over many years but rarely have Chinese product and service brands been singled out with an indepth mainly qualitative research study In total 167 established Chinese brands were included in the study for which consumers were surveyed across seven of the worlds most developed market economies the United Kindom France Spain Germany the United States Australia and Japan Worldleading advertising and public relations agency WPP and global market research company Kantar Millward Brown collaborated with Google to produce the pioneering report The reports overall findings make for extremely encouraging reading for those Chinese brands hoping to continue their expansion deeper into overseas markets More and more Chinese brands now enjoy increasing brand awareness levels But the reports most significant claim concludes that the circumstances are now very favorable for Chinese brands to build powerful brands based on their high quality and emotional connections with overseas consumers Lenovo Chinas PC giant and the worlds largest producer by sales volume was named the most powerful Chinese global brand builder at present This should come as no surprise given Lenovos clear commitment to international expansion ever since its audacious acquisition of the IBM PC brand well over 10 years ago Close behind Lenovo comes another consumer electronics brand success story in the shape of Huawei Chinas giant multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company headquartered in South Chinas city of Shenzhen in Guangdong province In recent years Huawei has proven it can compete with even its fiercest rivals such as Apple and Samsung Huaweis acclaimed P9 smartphone provides demonstrable proof of the companys commitment to technological innovation high quality standards brand building and it is rumored that an even better model the Huawei P10 could be launched very soon Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba is ranked third which should also come as no surprise given its fairly recent listing on the US stock exchange Chinese consumer electronics brands represent a large share of the higherranked brands with smartphone brand Xiaomi coming in at number 5 the third consumer electronics brand in the top 5 The report finds that these higherranked brands now compete far less in price than they used to and have gained an enviable reputation for quality reliability and service in the minds of overseas consumers But in addition to a cluster of strong consumer electronics brands Chinese internet brands are also making more than a good name for themselves around the world and are seen by many overseas consumers as very competitively innovative The report does still present challenges facing Chinese brands in their quest for global recognition and relevance Overseas consumers despite growing acceptance of and trust in Chinese brands reveal an almost habitual reach toward longerestablished global brands rather than the Chinese new kids on the block But even this habit appears to be waning as Chinese brands prove themselves more and more and rely on price less and less It is also apparent from the report that consumer likelihood of purchasing a Chinese brand over an established nonChinese rival brand varies from country to country In France Germany and Spain for instance consumers appear far more likely to consume a Chinese brand while Japanese British and American consumers still hold stronger attachments to locally produced brands Furthermore geographical proximity can at least partially contribute to brand recognition There may also be some sort of hangover effect taking place due to which American and Japanese consumers still hang on to the past even the very recent past when their countries were widely seen as technological pioneers But now according to the study consumers are increasingly looking to China and Chinese companies for the latest technology breakthroughs making now the most opportune time for Chinese brands to penetrate global markets Gone is Chinas image of low prices and low quality in its products and brands This decline in negativity which dogged Chinese brand building in the past has also been matched by an increase in consumer involvement when deciding on brand consumption choice The report finds that fame alone is no longer as significant a factor as it once was when consumers choose brands Instead a more rational conscious and selfconfident consumer now places tangible benefits and relevance higher This has helped Chinese brands compete with brands which have enjoyed international fame for far longer Harnessing the power of the internet also explains the international rise of many Chinese brands such as Alibaba and Tencent Chinese internetdriven brands have shown that it is not necessary to initially focus on the domestic market to ensure steady growth but that internetdriven innovation can allow a brand to explode on to the global scene with almost overnight success Despite a welter of positive findings the report does also provide a sobering assessment of the challenges facing Chinese brands in increasingly competitive overseas markets High among these challenges is the need for even more creativity and innovation perhaps not in the use of the latest technology but in brands marketing initiatives Innovation in technology is an absolute necessity on todays global battle of the brands but it is not on its own sufficient Brands have to build on this very tangible form of growth with layer upon layer of emotional meaning that resonates with consumers increasing need for emotionallyfulfilling lifestyle experiences Creativity in all aspects of a brands appearance and promotion is now the next hurdle for Chinese companies to overcome But even here there are encouraging signs with Chinese companies such as Huawei investing heavily in sports and entertainment sponsorships to build emotional connections with overseas consumers augmenting its reputation for quality and service So what could this all mean for European businesses Should Chinese brands be seen as friend or foe At a glance the answer to this question may appear to be the latter but looking into the question further should yield a different conclusion This is good news for European industries in which the rise of Chinese brands internationally represents many substantial opportunities Chinese brands will now be seeking more longterm cooperation with European partners all along the supply chain for example European brands can also now see their Chinese competitors as an opportunity to learn from their technological excellence in particular The idea that the rise of Chinese brands internationally poses a significant threat should be dispelled when pinpointing the sources of Chinese brands success It was and still is the firm presence of Western brands across the China mainland that initiated this brandbuilding path Chinese companies learned extensively from these newly arrived Western brands and were spurred on to become even more competitive than their established Western rivals If Chinese brands can rise to the arrival of Western brands in China then surely European brands can do likewise now that more and more Chinese brands have arrived in their backyard The author is a visiting professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and a senior

378,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064790.htm,Controlling the looming economic risks,China should strengthen communication about its policies and takes steps to stabilize its exchange rate According to the latest Central Economic Work Conference of China preventing and controlling risks is a very important part of its policies While the global market is in a period of flux preventing and controlling financial risks in China is more meaningful than ever Developed countries such as European countries and the US have seen the effects of globalization and are taking steps to encourage overseas capital and manufacturing industries to come back to the developed economies Meanwhile many countries including China no longer have the advantage of cheaper labor costs These factors could result in some changes in the global industrial chains specialization and then influence international capital flow To the emerging markets including China this can mean capital outflow and more challenges in export The differentiation of global monetary policies and the expected rise of interest rates would help drive capital to flow from emerging markets to the developed countries China should prevent the risks brought by both the real estate industry and RMB exchange rate at the same time In the past few years a large amount of global capital entered the emerging markets in different ways and gathered at the real estate industry and stock market where the profit rates were relatively high As Chinas own currency was not the international reserve currency there are problems with currency and maturity mismatch Once policies change the previously inflowed capital will be evacuated rapidly which could cause the collapse of assets value depreciation of the RMB the slump of the stock market and other systematic risks At present the US dollar is becoming stronger and the RMB is under great pressure of depreciation Meanwhile the domestic real estate market is under stricter control and capital outflow is growing stronger If the real estate market is overcooled or causing individuals to sell their properties and invest overseas this will aggravate the depreciation of the RMB Under these circumstances the control policies over real estate should be tailored for different cities rather than being the same throughout all of China A certain degree of capital control needs to be maintained especially the supervision of capital outflow of companies that are following Chinas going out strategies For example some companies are disregarding cost when doing overseas acquisitions paying high prices for no reason China should strengthen communication about its policies and take steps to stabilize its exchange rate China should also be cautious of unexpected rapid inflation Since last year the producer price index PPI of industrial products has been much higher due to supplyside reform and exchange rate fluctuation The consistent rise of the PPI will affect the consumer price index CPI If we take international factors into account Donald Trumps policies to help with the US inflation and economic recovery could also lead to global expectation of inflation which would indirectly influence Chinas domestic bonds stock market and commodities prices Moreover if the inflation exceeds expectation it would restrict what Chinas monetary policies could do making it difficult to prevent and control future financial risks It is also crucial to prevent global sources from spreading financial risks to China in the current global political and economic environment In Europe political turbulence has affected the financial market in the Eurozone Several important elections will be held this year including those of the French president and German chancellor and Brexit is to be carried out soon The banking system in the eurozone also faces challenges especially the fragile banking system in Italy which could affect other banks in the eurozone These factors will affect the eurozone even global trade and monetary policies and have a huge impact on the global financial market In the US new President Donald Trumps policies could raise uncertainties and influence global expectations for inflation and the global financial market Trump might make big changes to the US current macro policies Trumps stated policies on trade are a form of deglobalization which may in a short time affect Chinas exports and apply more pressure to the RMB At present it seems China has underestimated the changes that might take place in the ChinaUS relationship after Trump takes office As many lowincome people in developed countries didnt benefit much from globalization Trumps policies will cater to their desires China should negotiate on that should the free trade process be blocked If Trumps fiscal policy is carried out it will encourage the rising expectation of inflation likely causing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to deal with inflation further pressuring Chinas RMB depreciation Song Ke is deputy director of the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University of

381,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064785.htm,Gearing up,As Trump calls on manufacturers to return to the US what are the prospects for Chinas industrial strategy Where next for manufacturing The geographic location of factories and production has become one of the more hotly debated issues in recent months At an executive meeting of the Chinese State Council chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Dec 28 a guideline was issued to encourage more foreign investment in highend manufacturing in China This would underpin the Made in China 2025 strategy for the country to become a global leader in such areas as rail transport robotics motorcycles and industrial design within the next decade Meanwhile US President Donald Trump has called upon US manufacturers to return their production from China and elsewhere to the United States to create jobs there Ford has already canceled plans for a 16 billion plant in Mexico and will build one in the US instead Arguably with labor costs once the primary driver for offshoring now a smaller component of overall production costs because of increased automation manufacturing is becoming increasingly mobile and can be located in developed countries with higher labor costs In October Fuyao the Chinese autoglass maker opened the worlds biggest glass plant in Moraine Ohio where labor costs are eight times higher than in China It wants to get a larger slice of the US market and some believe that this might be part of a trend of Chinese manufacturers playing a role in Trumps socalled jobs revolution The Chinese government wants its own companies to invest in manufacturing in China partly to stem the flow of capital out of the country which has a weakening effect on the countrys currency The StateOwned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission issued a notice in January saying it was to monitor overseas investment by stateowned companies in certain sectors Peter Williamson professor of international management at Cambridge Universitys Judge Business School says China is aiming to build an advanced highend manufacturing sector which will be a core platform for the overall economy It knows full well it cant build a highincome economy based on lowcost laborintensive manufacturing he says It needs to build a more highvalue industrial base some of which it will be able to do itself but some of it will rely on investment by foreign companies Williamson a leading expert on Chinese innovation believes China will have little difficulty attracting such investment One of the advantages of the Chinese market is that it is the fastest growing and in many cases the biggest market in the world If you take a company like Apple almost a quarter of its profits and almost all the growth in its volume came from China Eric Thun the Peter Moores associate professor in Chinese Business Studies at Oxford Universitys Said Business School says that despite progress there are still challenges for China in upgrading its industry He cites the semi conductor industry which receives large government subsidies but is still heavily reliant on imported chips in particular from the US for its highend gadgets There are still limitations as to what Chinese semiconductor companies can do says Thun The American academic who is an authority on the China automotive sector says there have been challenges in the past in opening up these new sectors for investment Sometimes it has worked and sometimes it hasnt There have been these concerns in the international business community over the past couple of years about uncertainty he says There is frustration that the government wants to loosen things up for investment in some areas but makes it difficult for everyone else in others Whether the new US administration succeeds in persuading more of its native companies to base their operations back in their homeland remains to be seen There is however already an established trend for companies moving some of their activities back According to research by the nonprofit organization Reshoring Initiative some 249000 jobs were moved back in the five years up to the end of 2015 This was more than the 220000 that left between 2000 to 2003 seen as the peak period for offshoring globally He Weiwen vicepresident and senior fellow of the Center for China and Globalization Chinas leading independent think tank believes there is a limit on what can be moved back He points to US Department of Commerce statistics which show that the value added per employee for US multinational overseas operations is 29 percent higher than that within the US The only way to bridge that would be for Trump to cut the corporation tax rate from 35 to 20 percent and then impose a 10 percent tariff on goods of these companies coming back into the US That would still not account for the higher medicare and legal costs involved in employing people in the US he says All this however would be a major violation of World Trade Organization rules He a former economic and commercial counselor at the Chinese Consulate General in New York and San Francisco believes it will be a challenge to get US companies to invest more in Chinese manufacturing In my exchanges with American businesses in China they are not concerned with manufacturing but getting more access to services not only financial services like banking and insurance but also legal consulting leisure and medical services Williamson at Cambridge who was speaking from Switzerland after attending the Davos forum says the problem with some of the current debate is that it is couched in terms of manufacturing still being vertically integrated and companies doing everything in one location He says that model began to die out in the 1990s driven to a large degree by China and now the whole production system is built on global supply chains When Donald Trump talks about bringing manufacturing back what exactly is he talking about The real question is what bits of this complex global supply chain can be moved and the economics are going to be different depending on which part of the chain you are taking about because some bits are capitalintensive and some laborintensive It would be quite some paradox if the bit that gets moved back to the US is the final assembly operation Fuyao was not the first Chinese manufacturer to set up a production facility in the US Wanxiang Group based in Hangzhou has made a series of acquisitions in the US including buying bankrupt A123 Systems a battery maker for 256 million Edward Tse chairman and founder of Gao Feng Advisory the management consultancy says a pattern is emerging of Chinese companies doing relatively lowend manufacturing in the US and buying up highend facilities in Europe We have had a lot of clients come to us looking to make acquisitions in the US particularly in automotive parts consumer retail and areas like building materials he says When it comes to areas like highend manufacturing they are looking to make acquisitions in Germany the UK and places like Switzerland and Austria Tse author of The China Strategy says this separation has emerged mainly because of US resistance to Chinese technology companies like telecommunications giant Huawei making investments in the US What you are seeing instead is Chinese money in startup investments in Silicon Valley Seattle and on the east coast around Boston and Cambridge They are often part American and part Chinese ventures and because they are small they are subject to much less scrutiny Jeffrey Towson professor of investment at Peking Universitys Guanghua School of Management says even if there is a major wave of Chinese manufacturing investments in the Rust Belt or major reshoring by US companies it is unlikely to create the jobs that Trump craves The biggest impact on manufacturing jobs in the US has not been offshoring to Asia or China but the advance of technology he says It is wiping out jobs far faster than offshoring ever did It is going to be an increasing phenomenon and is not a trend that will reverse itself Thun at Said Business School believes China is following the right strategy in trying to upgrade its manufacturing by partnering with foreign firms This has so far involved acquiring German firms There is some concern in Germany about losing their crown jewels particularly the familyowned mittelstadt small to mediumsized companies which are often willing to sell out For China to be successful in highend manufacturing they need to acquire some of these German institutional and educational structures that promote this type of precision engineering If you cant beat them at their own game you can always acquire them he says andrewmoodychinadailycomcn China Daily European Weekly 01272017 page1

metaphor for the existence of those who live on the island of Vommuli in the central western Maldives including hers The fruit you see here comes from all over the world she says pointing to the lemon plum and passion fruit none native to the island country Cui who goes by her English name Ice first came to the Maldives in October 2013 It was part my own choice part destiny says the 24yearold who was first hired by a photo studio in Dubai in 2012 Luxury hotel St Regis at Vommuli Island in the central western Maldives Photos by Zhao Xu China Daily Lin Xiaoli Wong Chiu Man Fan Qianyi For China Daily My job was to try to persuade customers to pay for touristy pictures taken of them with and sometimes without their consent I hated the fact I had to be pushy all the time and asked to leave after a mere six months But it was not as easy as she had thought The company which had paid her relocation expenses wanted its money back There was a second choice to go to the Maldives So she went And despite having no experience with a camera she found herself behind the shutter snapping pictures for tourists many of them Chinese The work continued for some time before Cui landed another job as a receptionist at a luxury hotel When the St Regis announced its preopening last October Cui joined the team as the hotels only Chinese butler In a way I feel that Ive been carried to the shore of the Maldives and to Vommuli by the current of fate Yet it has also been an upstream swim the position of butler is considered much more challenging and is of course higherpaid than that of a receptionist People come to the Maldives to relax and be free of worries But for those who are here for a living the daily problems from overcoming language barriers to battling loneliness often teem below the surface My English vocabulary was very limited when I first came Cui says Now I have absolutely no problem communicating with my Englishspeaking clients and colleagues The secret Before I learned by brain now I learn by heart Apart from Cui the St Regis Hotel at Vommuli has a guest experience manager and a dive center coach who are also Chinese The hotels spa has one masseuse who is Chinese Malaysian and when I was there in early December the hotel had also invited a Chinese chef from the St Regis Shenzhen to work with local chefs on Chinese cuisine with a twist Xue Rui the associate director of St Regis Hotels Resorts Greater China says the hotel management clearly has its highend Chinese customers in mind Its true that the Maldives the country of a thousand islands has myriad choices and the bulk of Chinese customers still head for middlepriced destinations However we believe in the potential the Chinese market holds for luxury travel Fan Qianyi 37 is the Chinese dive center coach A former merchandiser bitten by the travel bug she decided to be a coach not long after she learned diving Over the past few years the job has taken her to some of the worlds most beautiful beaches from Thailand and Malaysia to the Maldives The Maldives is different from all the rest in the sense that the islands are all very separated The result is a rather encapsulated way of existence that can in some ways wear you down Fan reckons that these days there are about 60 Chinese diving coaches in the Maldives of whom she knows about 25 Since we live on different islands we dont see each other very often Indeed friendships made in this part of the world are subject to change from the very beginning as Cui has learned over the past year or so In the Maldives we usually have one hotel for one island So a change of job usually involves island hopping says Cui who shares one bedroom with three of her workmates at the St Regis When I went to Dubai 10 girls from the same tourism school went with me Three of us eventually came here Now Im the only one whos still here And Fan believes that in the Maldives the constant sense of fluidity inevitably seeps into relationships that elsewhere would probably have lasted longer Romance does blossom here but is often shortlived Ive seen as many marriages often involving a foreign woman and a Maldivian man end up as divorces To be frank the Maldives is probably one of the most open Muslim countries Asked what she does in her spare time Fan whose contact with the wind and the sea is burnished on her face smiles and says Gossip This is a small place Once every year she spends time with her husband who introduced her to scuba diving outside the Maldives He has only come here once because I need have to go somewhere else The couple plans to migrate to Australia where Fan can do scuba diving and more For me the Maldives is a free long holiday too long Im afraid For Cui who has an older brother the pressure is mounting When I first left China in April 2013 I promised my parents that I would return within two years a promise that has been broken She went back to her home in Henan province central China and stayed for about three months between May and August last year Her father underwent a minor operation One thing thats constantly on my mind is my parents medical expenses they are OK now but there may come a day when they need costly treatment Ive seen people left untreated for financial reasons And I decided that this is not going to happen to my parents Almost all the money she has earned in the Maldives has gone into her savings account she says The monthly income including salaries and tips is usually between 7000 yuan 10227 9513 euros 8227 and 10000 yuan Its easier to save here because you dont have many places to spend on a tiny island Ive asked my parents to come but they didnt want to worrying about the cost When they became aware that here we commute in boats and sea planes instead of buses they became seriously worried about me With the full knowledge that in a few years she will be back in China probably her hometown where a suitable marriage and a stable life awaits Cui believes that the Maldives has given her much more than better English and darker skin My birthday is in October so when my last birthday came I had just joined the St Regis I expected nothing but my work mates and friends gave me the biggest surprise she says beaming They handmade a birthday cake sang Happy Birthday to me in Chinese and in a typical Maldivian way of celebrating a birthday threw me into the sea This is going to be my last stop in the Maldives When Cui first left China she was a secondyear student at a Beijing occupational school for wouldbe tour guides To be honest attending that school was more about paying money for a certificate than about receiving a quality education so I quit as soon as the right opportunity came up What sounds like a natural choice today must have been a bold move for a 21yearold who had never been abroad before The Maldives despite its soothing calmness is in fact for dreamers and risktakers those who dare to live differently Fan the diving coach knows all about that For the Maldives each one of us is merely a passing ship but as we do so the ocean waves leave their mark Under Maldives law youre not allowed to take anything away from this country not even a tiny branch of dead coral For me a net full of memories is more than enough zhaoxuchinadailycomcn China Daily European Weekly 01272017 page1

384,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064782.htm,Mexicos losses could be Chinas gains,Trumps recent pronouncements about auto imports and NAFTA may knock out nations biggest competition When it comes to the United States market Chinese and Mexican manufacturers have long been rivals Both groups export fairly similar types of goods Both have advantages in lower labor costs And they are now the No 1 and No 2 exporters to the US In most sectors whether it is toys or laptops Chinese manufacturers have become dominant However in a few key sectors most notably cars and autoparts Mexican manufacturers have been more successful and most frequently because of the North American Free Trade Agreement That is why US President Donald Trumps statements about wanting to renegotiate or dismantle NAFTA and USMexico trade are so important This could be very bad for Mexican manufacturers but possibly quite good for China Either way it looks like it will change the existing dynamic My argument for this is three points Point 1 In the US market Chinese manufacturers have consistently beaten Mexican manufacturers The types of exports coming from China and Mexico are fairly similar In 2015 electronic equipment was 26 percent of Chinas exports about 600 billion and 21 percent of Mexicos about 81 billion Machines engines and pumps were 16 percent of Chinas 364 billion and 16 percent of Mexicos 59 billion The other major categories such as furniture lighting signs plastics and medical and technical equipment are also similar between the two countries The biggest differences you see between Chinese and Mexican exports are in oil and vehicles And what is most noticeable is that Chinas exports in almost all of these sectors now dwarf Mexicos This was not the case 15 years ago In 2000 Mexico was already six years into the enactment of NAFTA but China had yet to join the World Trade Organization According to the US Census Bureau Mexicos exports to the US totaled 136 billion in 2000 At the same time Chinas exports to the US were 100 billion Yet by 2010 Chinas exports to the US had soared to 365 billion far surpassing Mexico at 230 billion Also during 2000 to 2006 Mexicos export growth rate fell to 6 percent from its previous 15 percent during 19952000 and prior to China joining the WTO In 2016 Chinas exports to the US reached 423 billion compared with 271 billion from Mexico One can certainly argue that Mexico was actually increasing in overall exports to the US during this period China was just doing better However the quote that comes to mind is by Warren Buffetts partner Charlie Munger who said At Berkshire Hathaway we do not like to compete against Chinese manufacturers Mexican manufacturers probably now say the same thing Point 2 A big exception to this trend is in cars and autoparts where Mexican manufacturers have done consistently better The biggest exception to this China and Mexico export story is in vehicles and autoparts In 2016 Mexican global exports in this sector reached 90 billion making it the countrys single largest export at 237 percent And the US was the primary destination for a rapidly growing autopartsautomotive industry In contrast Chinas global exports in this space represented only 27 percent of their exports and totalled 627 billion The reasons for this are unsurprisingly NAFTA and Mexicos close proximity to the US It is simply much cheaper to transport cars and other heavy items from Mexico to the US and most final car assembly is done close to market However autoparts have less of a geographic factor and there is fairly complicated movement of parts components and various stages of assembly across Mexico America and Canada NAFTA is the other factor which has removed most trade and investment barriers between the US Canada and Mexico Virtually all of the major automakers have now centralized some or all of their production for North America to Mexico Today the importance of the automobileauto parts industry to Mexico cannot be overstated It is the countrys single biggest export and source of dollars now surpassing money sent home by migrants to the US Mexican car production has reached record numbers with more than 3 million cars produced each year Automobileautoparts are also one of the biggest drivers for foreign investment into the country Since 2010 nine of the major automakers have announced more than 24 billion in investments in Mexico with most targeting the US as their primary endmarket Point 3 US President Trump may now be changing NAFTA and the rules of USMexican trade This could be very good for Chinese manufacturers US President Trumps recent announcements of an intended renegotiation or cancellation of NAFTA have sent shockwaves through Mexico More than 7080 percent of all Mexican exports are going to the US and Canada ie the NAFTA members And whats worse Trump has specifically focused on Mexican produced automobiles and auto parts one of the most rapidly growing areas of Mexican manufacturing Trump has specifically called for a 35 percent tax on cars imported from Mexico Trump has also already criticized Ford General Motors and Toyota for moving facilities to Mexico and has stated they will have to pay this 35 percent tax to bring their cars into the US Ford had the unfortunate luck of announcing an end to all of their US production of small cars in the middle of the election which got a response from candidate Trump Ford have now canceled their planned 16 billion plant in Mexico Without question the potential for upcoming changes to NAFTA and car imports is already having a chilling effect on investment into Mexico However for Chinese manufacturers this could be a positive development For them this looks like their biggest competitor for exports to the US may be about to lose its biggest advantage a largely tarifffree border Plus Mexican exports to the US are heavily weighted to automobileauto parts the area Trump is focusing most on For China broad changes to NAFTA could result in a leveling of the playing field in certain sectors in terms of tariffs It is also worth noting that Chinese manufacturers have already been catching up with Mexican manufacturers in automobileauto parts just as they have in most other industries In 2014 China passed Canada and became the secondlargest exporter of automotive parts into the US after Mexico Even before the recent comments Mexican manufacturers were worried that China might be granted a lower tariff Ultimately there are a lot factors in each subsector when it comes to trade whether its tariffs shipping costs changing currencies or others So its difficult to generalize too much when it comes to Mexico and Chinese manufacturers However we can conclude that Trumps recent pronouncements about auto imports and NAFTA are much worse for Mexico than China And they raise a very intriguing question Without NAFTA can Mexican manufacturers successfully compete with China The author is the professor of investment Guanghua School of Management The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily China

385,2017/1/27,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/27/content_28064781.htm,Returning to the US Its a nonstarter,Taking some operations back to their roots wouldnt make any sense at all says expert Paul Ni believes it will be almost impossible for US companies to move their operations back to the United States to create jobs at home The 34yearold principal for management consultants Roland Berger says there is no logic for companies that have major operations in Asia and in particular China to do that US President Donald Trump has called for American companies to bring their manufacturing operations home You have on the one hand what he wants to come back to the US and on the other hand the reality of what can actually come back says Ni So far only US companies in Mexico have said they are moving some of their operations back General Motors has announced it is moving 450 jobs back Ford has axed plans for a 16 billion plant in the USneighboring country which industry sources claim was never going to get the final goahead anyway Ni speaking at his companys offices in Gateway Plaza Beijing says it would be highly damaging for some of his clients to up sticks from China and move back to the US He highlights the US chemicals company Cabot which has been in China for 30 years and set up a joint venture with Hengyecheng in Wuhai in Inner Mongolia in September last year to make silica The new investment will create many thousands of jobs It has done a considerable amount of work on that project including building a strong relationship with the local government Why would it have to close that plant and rebuild another one in the US It would just be illogical He says Cabot which has other hubs in Tianjin and Shanghai is a prime example of a modern US multinational company with 80 percent of its revenues coming from overseas Its growth is driven by Asia primarily by China The American market is not really a growth area for the company Ni believes Chinese autoglass maker Fuyaos decision to set up an operation in Moraine Ohio in October was driven by very specific factors The Volkswagen scandal relating to disguising emission levels is set to boost sales of US cars and therefore autoglass Fuyao already has a 60 percent share of the China market and needs to find markets outside the country The economic advantages relate to energy costs such as natural gas being between a third and half the price they are in China They are getting the land almost free The labor costs however are almost eight times those of China Ni argues it is not just the cost of labor that is likely to stop a flood of China manufacturers switching operations to the US but also the lack of skills now available Cao Dewang founder and chairman of Fuayo has admitted that he has had to employ mainly people over the age of 50 He can hardly find any young working adults suitable for such blue collar jobs This is because the industrial landscape has changed and is now very much serviceorientated rather than productionorientated so there arent the young people with these skills anymore Ni also cannot envisage Trump getting the steel mills in Pittsburgh rolling again with the Pennsylvanian city now more noted for its robotics industry We no longer talk about American companies in the steel sector to be honest It is either Japanese Chinese or European ones in highend steel production Ni who was born in Harbin but moved to Singapore as a teenager studied electrical engineering at the National University of Singapore before doing his masters at MIT in the US He began his career in investment banking with Credit Suisse in Singapore before going to study for an MBA at INSEAD in Fontainebleau France He joined Roland Berger one of the few international management consultancy firms that has developed out of Europe rather than the US in 2011 and now works for a wide range of clients in industrial goods packaging steel utilities and energy Ni believes that instead of manufacturing migrating out of China it is now more likely to remain at home given the current emphasis on developing a highend manufacturing sector The State Council issued a guideline in December aimed at attracting more foreign investment in manufacturing In China you have access to a more talented highly skilled and comparatively cheaper labor force China has transformed from lowcost production to a technologicallydriven and technically intensive economy The Government has achieved this by investing heavily in research and development he says Ni believes there is now a major opportunity for early stage European startup companies in particular to come to China to develop their products This does not just apply in manufacturing but more generally There is just a bigger market to test any concept with In the past companies might have tested their products in Sweden and the Nordic region with access to 20 million people before taking them to Western Europe In China they can do this on a much bigger scale The consultant says that any reservations companies may have had in the past about intellectual property protection are no longer as relevant They can come to China earlier and patent their product and then continue to upgrade it to make sure the application is not being copied later on Ni thinks some of Chinas lowend manufacturing will continue to move to South East Asian destinations like Thailand Vietnam and Laos but believes it will be at least another generation before it moves to Africa In Africa you have mining and some consumerrelated enterprises but you dont have a fully established industryrelated infrastructure You have the production of shoes and apparel but no more than that he says I would be confident that in 10 to 20 years you will see an automotive hub there Ni believes the real activity however will be in China which is now building many advantages over the US China has everything the US can offer to develop highend industrial activity There is a big market which is potentially more dynamic Even in areas like technology you have major successes such as Didi the China taxihailing service which has now merged its operations with Uber he says andrewmoodychinadailycomcn China Daily European Weekly 01272017 page7

valueadded ladder SinoFortone may not yet be household name in the UK but the company is committing billions of pounds of investment in crucial UK infrastructure projects with a clear strategy of using the foothold to grab opportunities in Europe and along the route of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative SinoFortone first made a name for itself in the UK during President Xi Jinpings 2015 state visit by announcing an investment of 2 billion 25 billion 23 billion euros in two biomass power stations in Wales and 100 million in Londons new Paramount entertainment park Since then it has signed a deal with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to lead a Chinese consortium to invest 10 billion in Scotlands infrastructure SinoFortone has invested in a renewable power plant in Anglesey Wales Provided to China Daily We are confident about the UKs investment opportunities despite shortterm Brexit uncertainties says Peter Zhang chief executive of SinoFortone In the UK we would focus our investment strategy on renewable energy projects and social housing as those sectors require more investment provide desirable revenue return and have turnaround time periods that suit our investment agenda Although returns on infrastructure projects vary Zhang says on average they can generate about 8 percent return on capital which is not high compared with projects in emerging markets Instead of looking for immediate financial returns we are more concerned with building our reputation in the UK gaining experience in this mature market and using our UK resources and enhanced brand image to grow into other international markets Zhang says Sinofortone is a joint venture between Sinolinks Group and Liaoning Fortone Group Liaoning Fortone is a private construction business in Shenyang that focuses on investment in largescale projects and becoming a construction partner in those projects Sinolinks is a Chinese company focusing on asset and fund management commodity trading and mining Capital is one advantage it has in the UKs current infrastructure and housing investment market Its ability to source costeffective materials in the supply chain from China is another core advantage The UKs public sector strain on infrastructure capital has been exacerbated by the British publics vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 meaning the UK may no longer be eligible for valuable European infrastructure funds The UK may lose eligibility for the socalled Juncker Plan which aims to unlock 315 billion euros 334 billion 270 billion of infrastructure investment between 2015 and 2017 Currently the plan includes eight major UK projects worth a total of 82 billion euros which could create more than 70000 jobs Whether the funding continues will depend on the UKEU exit negotiations In that context the British government is eager to attract Chinese funds During the eighth Economic and Finance Dialogue in London in November it showcased 13 projects offering more than 5 billion in investment opportunities to Chinese investors Concerns emerged after China General Nuclear finally inked its agreement to invest in the UKs Hinkley Nuclear power station in October and the new British government led by Prime Minister Theresa May announced new rules for scrutinizing foreign investment in infrastructure projects that involve national security but Zhang is not worried Our investment mostly focuses on renewable energy like wind solar wastetoenergy and biomass which have no national security concerns unlike nuclear Zhang says In addition to capital investment SinoFortone also helps European projects become more cost effective through sourcing equipment from China which could cut material costs 30 to 50 percent Zhang says The two biomass power stations will generate up to 299 megawatts of power each and will be built using technology from British partner Orthios Eco Parks which developed the innovative technology to create electricity from plants So far in 2016 Orthios and Zhangs team have raised 30 million in the UK from bond issuance which is already invested in the initial phases of the power station Currently factory construction does not have a timeline as it is waiting for the UK governments Contract for Difference auction an energy subsidy allocation process which was delayed by the Brexit vote from 2016 to spring 2017 It is a standard process wherein the government subsidizes the price difference between what consumers pay and what power companies charge to make their investment profitable Once we start construction the power station can become operational in two years Zhang says Construction for the second biomass power station in Wales in Port Talbot will begin once the Anglesey power plant is complete Despite the Anglesey delay SinoFortones involvement in renewable energy has secured it opportunities to negotiate deals with various governments for infrastructure investment including Kazakhstan Greece Georgia Angola Guinea and Pakistan Securing the UK renewable energy deals helped us establish a good reputation and greatly helped push forward those deals in Africa and in the Belt and Road countries where we could also play a role in bringing advanced UK technology Zhang says SinoFortones investment in the two biomass plants is welcomed by Orthios though the fact that the technology was unproven in the market had made fundraising difficult Orthios was founded over a decade ago by Sean McCormick an architect and Lewis LeVasseur an engineer Orthios had already secured planning permission and relevant approvals before SinoFortone joined the project We have spent five years researching and developing this model and the investment from China will help us roll it out across the planet says McCormick chief executive of Orthios Chinas focus on green energy and its ability to take a longterm view was instrumental in securing the deal McCormick says adding that the two biomass plants combined will create 1000 fulltime jobs as well as thousands of jobs during the construction phase Industry analysts see the collaboration as a winwin for both the Chinese and British sides Danae Kyriakopoulou head of research at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum a Londonbased think tank says SinoFortones investment in Wales is an important example of how China is increasingly using its resources to invest in highinnovation knowledgedriven economies Appropriately for an economy in the phase of industrialization China has traditionally focused its investment on resourcerich economies that have in exchange provided it with the raw materials it needed to fuel its development Kyriakopoulou says However China is now looking beyond the purely financial returns on investment as it seeks to move up the ladder in the global chain of valueadded In March SinoFortone led a Chinese consortium to sign an agreement with the Scottish government to invest 10 billion in Scotlands infrastructure covering projects in transportation power stations and social housing China Railway No 3 Engineering Group is also part of the consortium and is expected to provide technical support We saw market demand in Scotland for those new infrastructure projects so we wanted to help the Scottish government fulfill those demands Zhang says Our advantage in engaging with those projects is our capital investment and our ability to bring Chinese elements One example of Chinese construction techniques to be deployed in Scotland is prefabricated modular housing which could be 30 percent more cost effective than onsite construction In addition to infrastructure projects SinoFortone is also increasingly engaging with the UKs tourism market riding an increasing number of Chinese visitors In December it purchased The Plough at Cadsden the pub in rural Buckinghamshire where thenprime minister David Cameron treated President Xi Jinping to fish and chips and a pint of beer in 2015

inclusive Ten years ago Peng Jindong then 21 set up a small estore called Mmaicco to sell streetdance wear on Taobao Chinas largest online marketplace operated by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Peng was then based in Zhengzhou Henan province Little did he realize that financial innovation brought about by the liberalization of financial services and the advent of new Chinese private sector banks in offline and online channels would help him to expand his business to mens and womens clothing Pengs business expansion in subsequent years was a result of online shopping giant Alibabas 2010 decision to offer easy loans to merchants on Taobao As one of the first group of traders who received loans he borrowed 5000 yuan 719 677 euros 596 with sales orders for collateral Later he relocated to Hangzhou Zhejiang province rented a 140 square meter apartment and hired a few hands to run the business Again it was Alibabas loan that made it possible This time round the loan was much bigger 100000 yuan When Ant Financial an Alibaba subsidiary launched an online private bank called MYbank in 2015 Peng received a credit quota of 1 million yuan Based on his previous record he did not have to pledge anything or offer any collateral to MYbank That emboldened him to become ambitious He wanted to launch his own clothing brand outgrowing the salesonly phase of his business So he spoke to a loan officer of MYbank about a possible bigger loan MYbank assessed risks using big data analysis and decided to increase his credit limit to 2 million yuan That helped Peng to contract a small clothing factory hire five fashion designers and more than 10 employees He also rented a 1000squaremeter office and a warehouse of the same size in Hangzhou Our company is still very small But just like Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba I also want to run a business for 102 years he says He adds And do a lot of things He already owns a clothing brand and will open an offline store next Pengs success is as much a tribute to his cando spirit as it is a shining example of MYbanks effectiveness in Chinas liberalized banking industry As an online bank with no offline branches it relies on internet technologies like big data and cloud computing to make lending decisions and assess and manage risks It has positioned itself as a specialist in all things small that is its deposits loans and customers mainly selfowned businesses farmers and startups founded by college students in rural areas are all small By the end of November MYbank had served more than 2 million micro and small enterprises lending each 15000 yuan on average Its loan balance was 254 billion yuan up 243 percent from the beginning of last year Starting in June 2016 it also began offering micro and small business owners a free online product that analyzes financial data of their business thoroughly This means they no longer have to make rough calculations of their profits or losses Currently 500000 micro and small enterprises are benefitting from the product That is all in stark contrast to the past This change in Chinas financial services sector began with the launch of a trial program in 2014 to set up the first five private banks including MYbank The China Banking Regulatory Commission has gradually accelerated approvals for the establishment of such banks As of Jan 10 the CBRC has approved 17 private banks Seven of them have opened for business already Among the new kids on the banking block are Beijings Zhongguancun Bank named after the area where it is located also known as Chinas Silicon Valley and Jiangsu Suning Bank Co Ltd founded by electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and a few other companies in Jiangsu province At a news conference on Dec 8 Ling Gan director of the CBRCs City Commercial Banks Supervision Department said the regulator will continue to push forward the orderly establishment of private banks as long as the applications for banking licenses meet regulatory requirements and the founders are well prepared The first five private banks tried to innovate their models of development and bolster weak spots in the traditional financial sector They are trying to provide more targeted and more convenient financial services to communities startup companies as well as micro small and mediumsized enterprises Ling said The CBRC requires private banks to choose a clear market position and make different business strategies from existing banks based on regional economic factors and their shareholders resources The big idea is to modernize the banking system So the first five private banks have been reaching out to micro and small businesses or individuals in relatively lowincome groups that were neglected by traditional banks Some of the new banks played to their strengths in ecommerce social networking or big data while others exploited their geographical and local policy advantages For instance WeBank an online bank founded by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd launched personal loans ranging from 500 yuan to 300000 yuan without asking for any collateral or guarantee In addition to the consumer credit report provided by Chinas central bank WeBank says it mines information from social networking patterns and online transactions of loan applicants through multipurpose apps WeChat and QQ which belong to the Tencent stable In late November WeBanks small consumerloans served more than 60 million people in 549 cities in China most of whom were not clients of traditional banks WeBank data found that 65 percent of the borrowers were aged 25 to 35 75 percent of them were male and the top five industries where they worked were manufacturing technology trading public services and financial services WeBanks total collateralfree small consumerloans exceeded 160 billion yuan with bad loans less than 1 percent lower than the 181 percent average of commercial banks It is not as if private banks are making runaway progress as regulatory prudence in China tends to be conservative says Wu Qing director of the comprehensive research office of the Research Institute of Finance under the Development

chief executive For Roelof Joosten a love of life and milk led him to work in a dairy company When he landed the job of CEO of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina one of the worlds five largest dairy companies he refreshed its strategies and changed it to be a more purposedriven company Dutch people drink a lot of milk by nature and they have a love for milk It has been part of their daily lives for many years and we dont know what life would be without milk he says I joined FrieslandCampina because of what I learned from my previous work I believed I could help the company to go to a different level Working for the stakeholders in this case farmers is something I appreciate he says Roelof Joosten CEO of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina says the company primarily focuses on the infant formula market in China Provided to China Daily Recently he spoke to China Daily about the companys ecommerce expansion plans in China and emerging opportunities in smaller Chinese cities The following are the edited excerpts of the interview Do you have any plans to expand in China in the next few years We obviously want to expand further into infant formula but we also would like to enlarge the other categories predominantly food service cheese and ultraheat treatment milk We would like to put more effort into those three categories and diversify our business but at this time the most important category to play with is infant formula and we should not lose focus What are your competitive advantages over other international and Chinese brands FrieslandCampina is not in the game of volumes but into value creation In China we primarily focus on infant formula because we believe that we can create a lot of value there in how we control our quality and the safety of our product line We are one of the few producers who control the full dairy chain so its from grass to glass Do you mainly target highincome consumers Overall we target consumers with higher incomes For Friso the companys highend infant and toddler formula brand we still focus on first and secondtier cities in terms of distribution and we can still do a better job on that For Friso we can go deeper and wider into the Chinese market and use ecommerce to reach out to other consumers For example our cooperation with Suning Commerce Group Co helps us to reach out to those consumers in some third to sixthtier cities where we dont have any distribution In these cities we also target higher income consumers In the future we might reach out to the rural areas Whats your growth potential like with the twochild policy in China The regulatory change has had quite an impact on local producers as well as international producers With stricter rules the unprofessional players who take advantage of the opportunities in China have to leave the market That means there will be a lot of infant formula dumping in 2017 which will distort the market somewhat I think the market will recover from that in 2018 when the secondchild policy kicks in to have an impact on the market So I believe 2018 will be a year of full recovery and growth and in the years to come as well Do you plan to increase your RD efforts in China At the moment we are building a food services lab in Shanghai to support food service activities in China We have research centers in Wageningens in the Netherlands and in Singapore They are the focus centers for infant formula We have no plan yet to build a research lab in China but it might still be a possibility in the future Do infant formula products popular in Asia have any flavor difference from those in Western markets The recipes in China are slightly different from what we have in Europe There is a little bit of difference in the composition such as in content of protein and lactose as the requirements in China GB standards are different from Europe From the quality and food safety perspective there is no difference Why do you like to work for consumer companies The good thing is that you can see your own product and experience your product compare with competitors and bring your product to life It makes it more interesting if you work for a company like FrieslandCampina because you work for the farmers FrieslandCampina is owned by farmers Its a cooperative so we know our shareholders We aim to provide better nutrition the generations to come and a good living for our farmers Whats your management style like I try to assemble people around me most of them are much better than I am myself and I give them a lot of responsibilities In my previous jobs I hated it when the general manager looked over my shoulder You have to give them freedom to work and trust them Thats what Im trying to apply at my work I think that getting highcaliber people people who deserve trust and then giving them freedom is important so I can focus on the primary tasks of a CEO which are employee management and looking at the general direction and sustainability Im a downtoearth boss I was born in the northern part of the Netherlands and there is a saying says that you should never forget where you come from Another saying says that it could always be worse which keeps people humble How do you spend your weekend When Im not traveling on business trips I try to spend time with my family Earlier I traveled with my wife to the southern part of Argentina It was a trip that I wanted to do for a long time It was a very interesting and almost spiritual experience For the rest of my time on weekends I do sports I play golf and I run I have run two marathons I also bought a racing bike I want a healthy life because when I am on business trips theres usually not much exercise and a lot of eating and drinking which isnt good for the body Do you lead a green lifestyle I try to live an environmentallyfriendly lifestyle I separate my waste and we have energy and gas from green sources My car is a hybrid and uses both fuel and electricity These are only small things But it shows that whenever its possible we are trying to have a green approach to life Whats your favorite Chinese city I have been here many times since 1995 but I have not seen enough Chinese cities yet The cities I visited are very special in themselves Beijing has a rich history Shanghai breathes the international dimension into China so I like that as well Looking out from a hotel in Pudong was a very nice experience particularly at night I have no special preferences but I always like to visit new cities and to explore zhuwenqianchinadailycomcn

handover of Hong Kong Sir Malcolm Rifkind UK foreign secretary in the runup to the Hong Kong handover 20 years ago this year says he was going to choose a title for his autobiography that might have chimed with Chinese notions of longevity and respect for the elderly My first draft title for the book which my publishers were amused but not particularly impressed by was My Early Life The First 70 Years which a Chinese audience would have appreciated We are told the lifespan is going to be a lot more than it would have been once upon a time but this was seen as slightly frivolous Sir Malcolm Rifkind says leaving EU makes it more difficult for the Chinese to make decisions to invest in UK Nick JB Moore For China Daily The title eventually chosen was Power and Pragmatism concepts that perhaps best sum up the career of the respected Scottish politician who served as a cabinet minister under former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major for 18 continuous years a feat shared with three of his ministerial colleagues not achieved since the 1820s Rifkind who was speaking in the lounge of the Intercontinental London Park Lane Hotel in Mayfair says that pragmatic politicians differ from conviction politicians in that they dont feel guilty adapting their positions to circumstances The pragmatist is much more relaxed about it It doesnt mean the pragmatist has no convictions but if you are dealing with a problem and your previous conceptual or philosophical preference does not add up it is OK to ask what else would work In the book full of dry observations and witty anecdoteshe recounts the negotiations leading up to the handover of Hong Kong back to China on June 30 1997 He was foreign secretary up until a month before when the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the hand of incoming Labour prime minister Tony Blair and he himself lost his Edinburgh Pentlands seat in Parliament which he had held for 23 years He held his first meeting with Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen in London in 1995 and when he visited Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland the following January he was given the nickname in the local press of Li Wenjun meaning a cultured gentleman Much of the hard work had already been done by Margaret Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe the former foreign secretary who had negotiated the 1984 Joint Declaration that paved the way for the handover So I was just dealing with a number of unresolved issues or new issues that had arisen It was not too difficult he says Because we were approaching the moment of truth obviously within Hong Kong itself there was increased nervousness about what the changeover would mean Rifkind makes the point that Beijing resuming control of Hong Kong was an unprecedented event It was a unique problem which required a unique solutions so it is fair to say that Hong Kong remains governed by a different system to the rest of China he says The fundamental commitment to two systems in one country has been honored in the sense you know The book charts his career from an upandcoming Scottish advocate to being elected as a Member of Parliament when he was only in his late 20s Although gifted with an uncanny abilityhoned in debates at universityto speak without notes he is slightly bemused by his reputation as an intellectual which he modestly says belies his actual academic achievements at school His first cabinet appointment came under Mrs Thatcher when he was made secretary of state for Scotland in 1986 He believes Scottish public opinion remains firmly against independence and that as a result Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will not trigger a second referendum despite her rhetoric Mrs Sturgeon is a very clever lady and she knows if she had one she would almost certainly lose it Rifkind says he is not surprised that China has emerged as such a powerful economy over the past 40 years It was always inevitable that would happen You could not have a country the size of China with such a huge population as well as its historical and cultural identity going back 2000 years where that was not the case he says China should always have been a great power It should always have been the largest or second largest economy in the world He believes former Chinese leader Deng Xiaopings reform and opening up agenda in the late 1970s proved the catalyst Chinese societies that have had experience of capitalism have been brilliantly successful The economic reforms in China starting with Deng Xiaoping turned China into a capitalist system albeit with communist characteristics One of the UKs foreign policy shifts in recent years was the heralding of a new golden era of relations with China culminating in Chinese President Xi Jinpings state visit to London and Manchester in 2015 Some have suggested that new Prime Minister Theresa May is less willing than her predecessor David Cameron to fully embrace the worlds second largest economy The new government however did finally give the goahead to Chinese investment in Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in the west of England despite calling in the decision for review If Mrs Mays government had ended up rejecting Hinkley Point that would have represented a sea change That would have been fundamental but she didnt he says There were a number of safeguards that were insisted upon but Chinese investment in the UK economy and in particular its nuclear industry is continuing So to that degree there is continuity One of the major questions is whether the UKs referendum decision in June to leave the European Union will make it a less attractive place to invest Rifkind who supported the UK remaining in the EU says the countrys uncertain status makes it more difficult for the Chinese and others to make investment decisions Clearly any major companies from other parts of the world who have a European market with a headquarters in the UK ask themselves what does this mean for us He however believes the UK will prove itself to be resilient in the end If you only have 65 million people and you are the 5th or 6th largest economy in the world that is an enormous economic achievement That strength didnt begin when we joined the EU and it doesnt disappear because we have left it Rifkind had to resign his seat before the 2015 General Election having been caught up in a sting by the Channel 4 Dispatches program where he was secretly filmed discussing a potential board position for a fictitious East European company Suggestions there was a conflict of interest were later dismissed as groundless by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner The veteran politician who at the time of this interview was about to address a conference on the Middle East said he felt it was the right time to set the record straight on many aspects of his life by writing his autobiography Id always sort of assumed that in the dim and distant future I would write a book of this kind and it was about a year ago that I

Back in 2009 the Guangzhou governments give the park back to the people movement had the same bright idea proposing the removal of the walls around three of its biggest urban parks In this case however the plans were temporarily halted due to an outcry from local residents One elderly Guangzhou resident said Tear down the walls and you can no longer call it a park His argument was a linguistic one the character ��yu��n for garden is the Chinese word for public park 公园 gōng yu��n public garden uses the radical which comes from the ancient ideographic representation for enclosure Other citizens translated his concern into more practical terms without walls what was to prevent the park from becoming a free hotel for the homeless or a wretched hive of criminals who could enter and escape at will Encouraged by official directives to add recreational areas and green spaces to the urban landscape cities in China are increasingly building socalled openstyle parks 开放式公园 kāifàng shì gōngyu��n But the history of truly openplan publicaccess parks in China is short and the learning curve they present is steep Until the early 2000s most public parks in China defined simply as parks not reserved for use by any danwei 单位 dān w��i or work unit not only had walls and fences but charged admission to enter In 2002 Shanghai and the city of Zhuhai Guangdong province began to offer free admission to a limited number of their parks Beijing followed in 2006 However the terminology of openstyle parks is misleading in most cases even without a ticket office the parks have retained guarded entrances opening and closing hours and enclosures all around the perimeter Beijings Ming Dynasty City Wall Relics Park is a special case By the standards common to Chinese landscaping theyve gone and put walls on the wrong side Completed in 2006 the park consists of grassy knolls winding paths and flowering shrubs buttressed against one of the last remaining sections of Beijings ancient fortifications on the other side the grass runs straight up against the sidewalk Strictly speaking that makes us an openstyle green space not an openstyle park says the manager of the park office surnamed Shi Last October when Shanghais Xiangyang Park was reopened after renovations which included the removal of the parks outer walls the response from the community was lukewarm They dont understand that the wall itself is a part of landscaping its architecture a longtime park visitor was reported as telling local news blog Shanghai Guangcha Chinese landscaping scholar Yang Han has published papers that have been generally approving of the opening up of Chinas urban parks referring to the trend as the natural accompaniment for modern urban societys recreational needs However he has also argued that walls should not be blindly removed because their long cultural and symbolic history as well as architectural details make them an invaluable Chinese characteristic in landscape architecture Walls have played an indispensable role in the two ancient styles that influenced traditional Chinese landscaping the imperial garden 御花�� yù huā yu��n and literati garden 文人园林 w��nr��n yu��nl��n Imperial gardens originated from early imperial hunting grounds which were walled off to all users except for the emperor These later evolved into private retreats in which the emperor could relax and enjoy his diverse often exotic collection of plants As with City Wall Parks corner tower there is a sense the garden being a place to preserve and showcase objects of historical interest The literati garden of which the private gardens of Chinas Jiangnan region are the most famous example favored a simpler aesthetic consisting of native plants and more naturalistic arrangements Built with a philosophy of high walls and deep courtyards 高墙大院 gāoqi��ng dàyuàn they were meant to be secluded spaces for the scholars literary and spiritual contemplation influenced by the socalled hermit culture in the tumultuous Northern and Southern Dynasties 420589 period Under this culture educated men were encouraged to retreat from political life and cultivate their moral qualities in nature Stepping into a Chinese park still feels like discovering a private sanctuary Residents walk slower and without fear of being run over by bikes while the sounds of the city are muted behind the old melodies playing on the radio as seniors dance But Zhang Jie a landscape engineer attached to the Parks and Greening Management Bureau of Changsha Hunan province is not sure that such a place ought to qualify as a public park To him they fail to incorporate the first character of 公园 which is ��public Screened behind walls and fences recreation takes place out of the sight of passersby instead of being integrated into each residents sensory experience of the city This is a mode of life that Zhang calls participatory It was with the intention of increasing the participatory character of their communities that the Changsha government earlier last year gave the order to remove the walls around their public parks Our country has always advocated �getting close to peoples hearts and theres no better way than to welcome them to our spaces Zhang says These days while many universities and military units are still set up like this most urban residents of China find themselves living in their own apartments and crossing paths with strangers at every turn In essence this forces Chinese urban residents to adjust to a concept of public space where they must coexist with and respect the individual needs of others rather than the socialist communal space in which they shared with others a similar statemandated style of living To Zhang this is a positive development in helping residents get to know their neighbors their city their government However its also the source of much of the controversy in response to open parks in cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai as residents unease toward public spaces spills into the last remaining institutions that symbolized the old style of governance and security Zhang says he has not received any feedback from residents anxious about their safety or the suzhi 素质 or quality of their fellow park visitors after the removal of the walls though he admits that open parks are potentially more challenging to make safe and orderly for users The views from the ground are mixed On a weekday morning a knot of local residents exercising at the City Wall Park share their impressions of the parks good points and bad They unanimously say that ease of access is the main reason that they come to the park some of them every day Shi believes that her park has been more or less free from controversy due to the security investments taken by Beijing as a whole Each city has its own concept of safety a different threshold for accepting these open public spaces she says Residents of Guangzhou would probably have different concerns about its safety compared to the capital Fang agrees that the impression of public safety is not purely due to the presence of guards but the quality of Beijing residents This is a nice neighborhood

21day journey to India in 2003 She spent the first week in Rishikesh to learn traditional yoga The city is known as the yoga capital of the world with numerous yoga centers that attract visitors from all over the world She was a bit depressed when she first saw the citys streets after heavy rain narrow muddy roads stray dogs and vendors loudly hawking their goods When she first encountered Bhandari she was impressed that the young man in white robes was quiet and professional After one week of learning yoga postures from him her perspective began to change There were adorable dogs in the streets filled with sunshine and friendly locals with smiles on their faces In that week nothing changed but me As my body became relaxed and soft so did my heart she says Happiness can be simple Yoga taught me that happiness is about whether or not you are in a balanced and optimistic state When you are in society that state may be affected subconsciously But yoga can help you to remain positive It also stirred her creativity and she wrote a Chinese book Song of India the same year about the trip that changed her life In August 2003 Yin and Bhandari cofounded Yogi Yoga in Beijing a

holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture Its only fair that we should pay homage to one of the most ancient of Chinese deities in a food column devoted to a culture largely incubated in the territory he reigns over the kitchen Zaojun the Kitchen God is a fairfaced celestial being who spends only a few days in the heavenly court of the Jade Emperor For most of the year he presides over the heart and hearth of earthly households guarding the livestock the servants and most of all the cooking stove He is privy to the darkest secrets and he sees all From as long as we can remember the portrait of the Kitchen God seen here with his wife has reigned over the cooking stove in many Chinese kitchens Jin Yuequan For China Daily He listens to the back room gossip the quarrels among the womenfolk He witnesses the trickery of malingering servants the secret stashes of food hidden for a stolen feast the cutting of corners in the making of a complicated dish the whispered rumors the scandalous truths For those reasons when it is time for him to ascend to make his annual reports the whole household is suddenly alerted to his imminent departure and he is showered with food offerings to put him in the best of moods Yes even the gods must be bribed In this case the Kitchen God is sent off with an appropriate feast all of which will include a final offering that is very sticky and very sweet These sticky sweets the foolish humans hope will seal his lips or sweeten his tongue and he will return in the new year with the appropriate bountiful blessings from heaven after making a positive assessment of their merits Right now in kitchens large and small all across China the preparations are starting Zaojun will be traveling to report to his boss soon on the 23rd day of the last lunar month which is Jan 20 He has been doing this every year for a long long time as far back as the Xia Dynasty c21st century16th century BC more than 2000 years before Christ was born The Xia was the first recorded dynasty in Chinese history so it is likely Zaojun has been around even longer than that Basically the Kitchen God has been guardian of the stove ever since the Chinese started cooking indoors The day of his departure also signals the start to a flurry of preparations for the official arrival of Spring a week away His portrait probably smoky from standing over the stove for an entire year will be taken down smeared with honey and reverently burnt to send him on his way In the new year a brand new portrait will go up on the wall Meanwhile the kitchen and its inhabitants will be pretty busy There is even a folk rhyme to guide you through it all Twentythird pumpkin candies twentyfourth spring cleaning Twentyfifth tofu time twentysixth make meat stew Twentyseventh kill the rooster twentyeighth rise the dough Twentyninth steam the buns New Years Eve stay up late New Years Day celebrate Once Zaojun leaves replete with sticky pumpkinshaped candies the mops and dusters come out the next day and every dustball and each cobweb is industriously swept up and removed The more creative among the girls will start crafting beautiful paper cutouts from auspicious red paper Fruits and flowers the Chinese characters for happiness and spring images of deer and bats and other lucky icons all these will be pasted on windows and walls Those with good calligraphy skills will be called upon to write couplets of good wishes that will go across lintels and door frames All on red paper In the meantime an enormous amount of cooking will be done starting with the slaughter of the chickens ducks pigs and goats to the soaking of soy beans for the making of tofu Another important task is the bun making Steamed buns are very much part of the daily diet all year round but the buns for the New Year will be decorated with dates and shaped into impressive works of art In my own household Ayi and I will be creating flower buns cut from strips of dough artfully twisted into blossoms Ayi comes from Henan where the ladies are really good at turning dough into masterpieces of miniature architecture She has taught me how to press dried Chinese jujubes into the dough for instant effect The red fruits add color and flavor as well We also make piggy buns because the pig is of course a symbol of prosperity In the southern regions of China a sticky rice cake called niangao is also prepared The basic recipe is golden syrup and glutinous rice flour Occasionally red beans and coconut milk are added and the mixture poured into containers lined with bamboo or coconut leaves These days elaborate jelly molds are used to shape the cakes with fish molds being the most popular because fish is homophonic with overflowing abudance At this time of the year rituals and symbolic foods become part of the celebrations and even though some may seem to be based simply on superstitions they are still oddly comforting and very much part of the festivities that make a new lunar year so very special As for the Kitchen God Im pretty sure he enjoys the attention he gets every year and he never fails to return duty completed and ready for another year listening in on the household secrets paulinedchinadailycomcn To worship the god crafting paper cutouts fruits and flowers images of lucky

Festival will be celebrated by Chinese at home and abroad in a weeks time A good number of the countrys more than 200 million migrant workers will return home to smaller cities and villages bearing gifts for the children they have left behind in their pursuit of work in bigger cities A central government survey released in November suggests China now has 9 million children at or under the age of 16 whose parents work away from their domiciles In 2013 the All China Women Federation a governmentbacked agency said the country had 60 million such children under the age of 18 Analysts say the new surveys methodology is different from the previous one in terms of the childrens age as well as the categorization of absent parents Some sociologists expect an actual decline in the number in coming years with signs of more family migrations But a recent visit to East Chinas Anhui province which is among the top inland areas for outward migration showed that on the other side of the countrys economic boom lie villages and small towns that continue to battle a deep emotional void A girl and her grandfather live in Fuyang Anhui province In rural patches of Fuyang a large municipallevel city located more than 200 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital Hefei most residents are the elderly and their young grandchildren Here the working age population is simply missing Hundreds of empty houses dotted across farmlands provide further evidence of desertion In the Houyuan neighborhood of Wuli village for instance more than half of the 22 households have children in the care of their grandparents In adjacent Dongzhou of the settlements 65 residents the majority face a similar situation Local government officials estimate 28 million people from Fuyangs population of 10 million live in different parts of the country Guo Lin chairwoman of the Fuyang Womens Federation says the migrants mostly move to wealthier eastern provinces such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu and Shanghai to do lowlevel jobs in manufacturing services construction and other sectors As a result 179000 children under the age of 18 have been left behind in Fuyang she says The term used to describe such children emerged from the socalled leftbehind wives whose husbands had migrated from Anhui and other provinces such as Sichuan Henan Guizhou Hunan and Hubei to mainly coastal cities in the 1990s In the following decade the women themselves started to migrate A large number of female domestic helpers in Beijing came from Anhui back then The 2016 survey considers the legal working age of young Chinese and of families where both parents have migrated Guo says of the differences between the new central government study and ACWFs 2013 survey that counted such children even when one parent was missing Sociologists have previously also studied migration patterns in the rural reaches of relatively affluent places such as Chongqing and Guangdong province In the Houyuan area of Fuyangs Wuli village Zhou Peisheng and his wife Liu Guilan have been raising their granddaughter for the past three years The couples daughter and soninlaw are a waitress and a chef at a restaurant in Nanjing in Jiangsu province Its no trouble taking care of her she isnt naughty Zhou says of his granddaughter Ni Yuting aged 9 Her parents keep long working hours which is why Ni cant live with them in Nanjing he says Ni wants to see her parents more often and for longer periods than just during the annual holidays She also wants to know what gifts they will bring for me In Zhous neighborhood most working age couples have migrated to Hangzhou in Zhejiang province where the G20 Summit was held last year Zhou was once a crop farmer who worked parttime at rural construction sites in Fuyang Today he is among the betteroff people in his locality with income coming in from growing vegetables His daughter sends money home as well For Song Jinlan a 55yearold resident of Dongzhou area in the same Wuli village life is slightly harder The widow has been looking after her grandson since his birth six years ago Her son works in Hangzhou driving trucks that carry construction materials and her daughterinlaw works at a textile unit in the city Her son sends her 1000 yuan 145 1367 euros 12070 a month on average Song says In addition she earns some money from selling corn and other crops that she grows In 2015 Fuyangs per capita rural dispensable income was 9001 yuan on average per year Songs son and daughterinlaw come home every Chinese New Year and stay for less than two weeks This year the couple want to arrive ahead of the Spring Festival week to hold a ceremony to cut a few strands of long hair their son has been wearing since early childhood as a traditional symbol of good fortune But so far Song says her son hasnt been granted the extra leave he requested Without his parents around I sometimes feel helpless especially when the kid falls sick she says pointing to her grandson Zhou Junhao aged 6 In the town of Xihu some distance from Wuli village former schoolteacher Du Fengcai and his wife have raised two grandsons in the past 20 years Dus son a longtime migrant who now runs a hotel in the tourist city of Dali in Southwest Chinas Yunnan province cant take his 13yearold younger child along because of the limited options for education there Du says His older grandson aged 22 has joined his parents business in Dali Du longs for reform of the countrys household registration system or hukou to increase the educational prospects for the children of migrant workers in host cities While the first nine years of education are compulsory in China the existing hukou system throws some challenges at migrants The 2016 government survey makes mention of the reform too While at least 8 million grandparents form the backbone of secondgeneration parenting in China today this aging group with limited resources at its disposal is often unable to provide the emotional support that the grandchildren especially teenagers need Some problems of leftbehind children are being solved with the countrys economic progress but their psychological lives still need attention says Lu Shizhen deputy chairwoman at the China Youth and Childrens Research Association a Beijingbased affiliate of the China Youth University of Political Studies Lu advocates longterm professional counseling not just for the affected children but also for their primary caregivers The children of migrant couples are de facto orphans she says adding that a mix of economic and social reasons has triggered the situation According to the new survey a percentage of the 9 million children largely live without adult supervision on a daily basis effectively forcing them to stay alone In an appalling case last year police reported the deaths of four siblings aged 5 to 14 in Guizhou among the countrys poorest provinces In a suicide note written before they died the eldest said their mother who worked in a different place hadnt visited them in a year and a half Other than abject loneliness unsupervised children in particular are at risk of sexual abuse A few years ago 19 cases of sexual assault on girls under the age of 18 were registered in Henan province China Youth Daily reported With the majority of leftbehind children living in villages theres also a need to include more women in countryside Party committees Lu says Last year the State Council Chinas cabinet issued a set of guidelines for local governments to follow including setting up more child welfare centers

Forum which brings together leaders in politics business economics technology and society This year the main topic discussed was how to promote responsible and responsive leadership As shown by recent voting the gap between political leaders and civil society has never been as important as it is today Digital media are providing key instruments for reducing the gap Politicians and business leaders have embraced Twitter in order to stay in touch with their constituents turning them into followers But Twitter is only the tip of an iceberg Social media connected devices and big data will provide a better match between the expectations of voters and customers on one side and those of political and business leaders on the other A few weeks ago the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show CES once again offered a showcase for new digital opportunities in this area Leading telecom vendor ZTE presented its new Hawkeye smartphone which resulted from its innovative crowdsourcing project to develop a phone based on consumer choices Last year ZTE started collecting ideas from the Android community about the future smartphone they would like to see on the market Future users chose from phones with five core features such as eyetracking selfadhesive back waterproof VR mask functions and the ZTE is now in mass production thanks to the success of crowdsourcing Empowerment of the consumer is the future In the same vein WeChat the messaging service of Chinese tech giant Tencent is taking a big step to liberate smartphone users from the need to compare and download apps from Google Play or the App Store The main features normally obtained via apps are now available inside the messaging service via socalled miniprograms allowing users to make payments book a taxi order food book tickets etc The days of apps may be numbered It isnt just luck that these major innovations came from China A total of 1575 Chinese companies exhibited in Las Vegas one third of the total number of exhibitors second only to the US These numbers illustrate the increased contributions of China to the global economy not only in terms of innovation but also as an engine of economic growth Today China is progressively translating this economic power into political influence This was highlighted by media coverage of the keynote speech given by President Xi Jinping on Jan 17 due not only to the fact that it was the first appearance of a Chinese head of state at Davos but mainly because of his clear messages In his strong defense of globalization President Xi claimed that the only way to ensure growth and productivity is to work handinhand to improve global governance and make it more inclusive The president confirmed his countrys firm commitment to pursuing an enabling environment for foreign investments boosting domestic consumption developing advanced manufacturing and striving to maintain the positive momentum of the Chinese economy which has contributed as much as 30 percent to annual global growth since the financial crisis Xis message will have been music to the ears of the large delegation from the EU 12 commissioners out of 28 in Davos With the French and German elections in sight a major challenge for the Eurozone is to deliver growth Forecasts see growth in the Eurozone slowing slightly in 2017 after coming in at an expected 16 percent in 2016 Forecasts for 2018 are not much better GDP growth is predicted to stagnate at 15 percent in 2018 At the same time the Chinese economy is expected to grow at 65 percent in 2017 EU leaders are looking east particularly now that the incoming Trump administration is bringing substantial uncertainties about future EUUS and USChina trade relations The EU has much to offer China First there is a stable and predictable trade policy framework determined by the EU Commission under the active leadership of Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom who attended the Davos Forum explaining the opportunities offered by the EUs trade policy to the top Chinese business leaders who were present These included Alibabas Chairman Jack Ma China Telecoms Chairman Yang Jie Baidus Chairman Zhang Yaqin and HTCs Chairwoman

in the World Economic Forum The world is now at a crucial juncture facing either progress with globalization or retreat into protectionism and Chinese President Xi Jinpings call for open and inclusive growth in Davos this week came like a breath of fresh air injecting new confidence into global economic relations One can really feel the power of his messages in Davos where his words remained a hot talking point throughout the week of the forum President Xi spoke about marketdriven growth free trade environmental sustainability and fostering winwin partnerships globally With those messages China is stepping into its newfound role as a global leader filling in a vacuum once occupied by the US Despite leading the worlds largest economy President Donald Trump and his administration have shown protectionist tendencies driven by voters who feel left out of the benefits of globalization Under this context President Xis advocacy for free trade became more important and is yet another reflection of the Chinese ancient philosophy of mutual benefit and winwin partnerships which have shaped the countrys way of thinking for thousands of years Philosophy aside Chinas development is itself an apt reflection of the benefits of globalization When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 it felt worried that multinationals entrance into China would lead to severe unemployment But this fear was soon appeased as many Chinese firms became more vibrant and competitive due to globalization Industries with few trade barriers like technology benefited the most from globalization while those receiving government protection still experienced great inefficiencies such as the energy sector Over the years China has not only benefited from globalization but also contributed to other countries wealth and prosperity As Chinas manufacturing sector grew and it became the worlds factory consumers in Western countries enjoyed more wealth and consumption More importantly manufacturing jobs shift to China freed up the labor market in advanced economies like the US allowing them to focus more on highend services for which profit margins are much higher Meanwhile Chinas economic growth has created an expanding middle class whose consumption power is now having a huge influence on the world Consider the record number of Chinese tourists and students going abroad to advanced economies like the US allowing them to export products without physically shipping them overseas But the story does not end here because globalization is not just about trade it is also the exchange of ideas and building of platforms When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg visited Chinas technology giant Tencent for learning and inspiration Tencent welcomed him with open doors Many Chinese firms expanding overseas are bringing Western businesses into their existing ecosystems helping them to access the Chinese market Ecommerce giant Alibaba is now helping many US

427,2017/1/20,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/20/content_28006215.htm,A breath of fresh air,Global leaders take heart from President Xis stance on free trade at Davos Forum Global leaders once again gathered in the snowy Swiss Alpine resort of Davos this week to find new drivers for economic growth in 2017 and they seem to have taken encouragement from Chinas advocacy for openness and free trade For the first time ever the World Economic Forum was attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping who gave a keynote address vigorously defending free trade It was applauded by political and business leaders as a rich symbol of China taking the lead in global issues reflecting this years forum theme of responsive and responsible leadership There is no point in blaming economic globalization for the worlds problems because that is simply not the case Xi said on Jan 17 The fourday forum ended on Jan 20 and was attended by 3000 delegates Offering his suggestions for new sources of growth Xi stressed the need to develop a dynamic innovation driven growth model which leads to winwin cooperation fair and equitable governance and balanced equitable and inclusive development Klaus Schwab executive chairman of the World Economic Forum praises Xis address saying his commitment is crucial to the innovative open and inclusive world Were living in a global interdependent world and we cannot recreate artificial borders Globalization is a winwin situation and we have a common destiny as humankind Schwab says He acknowledges the Chinese Dream initiated by Xi while calling for a Global Dream a dream of a world that remains innovative open and fair The World Economic Forum in Davos founded 47 years ago has made a name for itself as both a gathering for global elites and an incubator of new ideas but this year Chinas strong participation made it special Xis remarks come at a critical juncture in history says Danae Kyriakopoulou head of research at the think tank Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum The US and the UK once the champions of economic liberalism and the proponents of globalization are retreating from the world stage and from integration with their neighbors In this context Xis speech was a refreshing showcase of his leadership on the world stage Kyriakopoulou says Xis speech comes at a time when sluggish economic growth in the West has led to signs of protectionist measures Populist leaders have been taking advantage of the dissatisfaction of those left behind by globalization US President Donald Trump who did not attend the forum due to his inauguration pledged during his election campaign to pull out of the 12nation TransPacific Partnership Meanwhile the UK is experiencing Brexitrelated uncertainties after the British public voted to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum Aside from Xis address Chinas representation at Davos this year is unprecedented Insightful sessions by Chinese entrepreneurs like Dalian Wandas Wang Jianlin and Alibabas Jack Ma have been hugely popular The interest is easy to understand especially considering Alibaba made history as the largest Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 Dalian Wanda made headlines in 2016 with the 35 billion 32 billion euros 28 billion purchase of production house Legendary Entertainment becoming the first Chinese company to own a major American film company Chinese firms are shaping and shaking the world economy but so are many Chinainitiated trends and concepts Chinas Belt and Road Initiative Chinas outward direct investment Chinese firms globalization and Chinas middleclass consumers are hot topics repeatedly featured at panel discussions this year Perhaps China is now inseparable from the global economy China advances on all fronts and no longer hesitates to propose its own models its own values says Andre LoesekrugPietri founder and managing partner of ACapital a private equity fund Three years after Xi proposed the Belt and Road Initiative which seeks to increase Europe and Asias trade and investment relationships through improved infrastructure it has received support from more than 100 countries and international organizations More than 40 countries and international organizations have signed cooperation agreements with China and Chinese companies have made more than 50 billion of investment spurring the economic development of these countries and creating many local jobs The Chinaled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is introducing a new model for multinational development banks Whats striking about the AIIB is its ability to deploy lots of capital especially by pulling capital from the private sector In scale and ambition many older generation multinational development banks can learn from it says Lord Mark MallochBrown former United Nations deputy secretarygeneral As China increasingly plays an important economic role internationally the country is also opening up and liberalizing its domestic market a comment Xi reiterated at Davos In 2016 the Chinese government significantly increased foreign access to its domestic bond and stock markets The internationalization of the renminbi marked by its inclusion in the International Monetary Funds basket of special drawing rights currencies is seen as a great contribution to global financial stability Increased usage of the renminbi in global trade transactions and as a reserve currency by central banks in a number of developed and developing economies will in time reduce vulnerability to bouts of US dollar strength says Phyllis Papadavid a senior research fellow of the Overseas Development Institute think tank The renminbis inclusion in SDR and its growing internationalization is a reflection of Chinas ongoing financial deepening and expansion Chinese policymakers are likely to continue to set the conditions for further financial and economic liberalization Papadavid says But Chinas international leadership is not just reflected in economic issues as Davos participants highlight Helen Hai a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization says China can take a leadership role in achieving sustainable development goals especially by sharing with other developing countries its own lessons in industrialization and poverty reduction Im so glad to see such huge participation from China this year at Davos China has made significant contributions in the Millennium Development Goals it achieved the biggest poverty reduction globally and going forward China is going to tell the world how it has transformed itself Hai says Last year the Chinese government released plans aiming to lift all of Chinas poor by current standards out of poverty by 2020 10 years ahead of the schedule set by the UN sustainable development goals To help other developing nations achieve their targets China also pledged aid through the Chinainitiated assistance fund for SouthSouth Cooperation and the ChinaUN Peace and Development Fund Business leaders also warmly welcomed Chinas continued commitment to the Paris climate accord on reducing carbon emissions In September 2015 China announced its aim to hit peak CO2 emissions by around 2030 and slash emissions per unit of the GDP by 6065 percent from the 2005 level Chinas voice at Davos is urgently needed says Tom Szaky CEO of TerraCycle a US recycling technology firm explaining Davos can help China develop important and timely alliances with businesses and nongovernment organizations on environmental issues China is taking the lead in terms of investing in a more sustainable future through changes in energy waste and other consumer patterns Szaky says Despite optimism over talk of growth at Davos many challenges still exist for global growth in 2017 perhaps further highlighting the importance of Chinas contribution Papadavid of ODI says she sees continued sluggish growth in the global economy as heightened political uncertainty in the US Europe and the UK could reduce investment intentions while protracted weakness in commodities is likely to reduce trade growth especially in emerging and developing countries Chinas economic transformation will be important The emergent strength in Chinas household sector is likely to provide a stimulus to global growth Papadavid says In his advocacy for globalization Xi stressed that China has not only benefited from economic globalization but also contributed to it He explained that rapid growth in China has been a sustained powerful engine for global economic stability and expansion while the interconnected development of China with a large number of other countries has made the world economy more balanced The numbers speak for themselves In the coming five years Xi said China is expected to import 8 trillionworth of goods attract 600 billion of foreign investment and make 750 billion of outbound investment Chinese tourists will make 700 million overseas visits Chinas contribution to global economic growth and its unprecedented participation at Davos have highlighted the countrys growing international leadership There is a vacuum when it comes to global economic leadership and Xi Jinping is clearly aiming to fill it says former Swedish Prime

of London chairman John Nelson sees is a perfect storm facing the global insurance market He says exceptionally low interest rates and an excessive amount of capital in the insurance sector are driving down both investment returns and premiums for insurers Nelson also notes the rapid development of technology which has also increased competition in markets by changing the relationship between insurers and their customers John Nelson chairman of Lloyds of London Getty Images Lloyds of London the worlds oldest market for specialty insurance and reinsurance is responding with a strategy known as Vision 2025 according to Nelson One of the highlights of the strategy is international expansion Central to that is China which will remain one of the most important frontiers for the institution as it continues to evolve from its start in a coffeehouse in London dealing in marine insurance in the 17th century to a global marketplace where more than 200 insurance brokers come to pool and spread risks Nelson spoke recently with China Daily about the insurance markets strategy and its plans in China The following are edited excerpts from the interview How do you see the growth potential of the Chinese insurance sector and what opportunities are there for Lloyds Over the last few years China has become an extremely important platform for the Lloyds market In Shanghai and in Beijing we now have over half of the Lloyds managing agents physically present on the platform 31 to be precise We have increased our business substantially on this platform to 792 million yuan 114 million 1077 million euros 92 million in gross written premiums in 2015 and we are confident we will surpass 2 billion for the past year We continue to see China as perhaps the most important growth market in the long term for Lloyds Insurance can provide vital support and protection allowing Chinese companies to offset risks and focus on growing their businesses In particular Lloyds has the specialist expertise for the sorts of large construction energy marine and transport projects that this country is investing in As a platform for international expansion Lloyds provides a really good springboard for Chinese insurers wanting to develop their international strategies For example China Reinsurance Group has joined the Lloyds platform We also signed a memorandum of understanding with China Taiping Reinsurance in October I think these things take time and that global carriers from China coming onto the Lloyds platform will increase How do you plan to further expand your presence in China Our Shanghai hub opened in 2007 and two years ago we opened a branch in Beijing which brought us closer to the major reinsurance market We have about nine managing agents on that platform and I am very pleased with the progress I think the main next step is to reinforce what we have already done Weve got the core of the market here Now the challenge for the participants is to increase penetration in specialist lines We are looking at new forms of distribution and are trying to get these specialist lines more into the veins and arteries of the Chinese economy How can Lloyds specialties and services meet the need for more sophisticated insurance products amid Chinas ongoing process of urbanization Increasing urbanization is in one sense making the economy more efficient and more interconnected But in another sense it is concentrating risks and the consequences are obviously more relevant if you have greater urbanization China is a classic example of a country that continues to rapidly urbanize The movement of people from the countryside to the cities is making economies more efficient but also making them more vulnerable to systemic shock What we are seeing is that the risk from natural catastrophes is increasing but also manmade risks such as cyberattacks What role can Lloyds play in Chinas Belt and Road Initiative The initiative will deepen trade ties between China and Europe and secure the future prosperity of generations to come in areas of the developing world And it has the power to reshape the economic landscape just as the original Silk Road did before it It will also provide new development opportunities for Chinese insurers international operations as well as global reinsurers with them providing capacity and global expertise And just as Lloyds was the backstop behind early maritime trade and the transport innovations that subsequently transformed our world so we are ready to partner with Chinese insurers to provide solutions to support and protect Chinas economic growth and Chinese business interests abroad How do you intend to attract more capital from Chinese insurers to Lloyds platform after forming partnerships with two of Chinas reinsurance firms I think over the next five to 10 years you will see a number of additional Chinese carriers coming onto the platform We want the process to be gradual and dont want see people rushing at making a commitment There is no point for the Lloyds market in a carrier coming on just for capital What we want is to make sure it is broadening our footprint and business We are also very keen to diversify the nationality base of the people on the Lloyds platform So if a carrier wants to come on to the Lloyds platform we are very keen that they put some of their best people into their Lloyds business We think that having Chinese people on the Lloyds platform will massively increase the expertise in the market China has established an insurance exchange in Shanghai with the ambition to develop its own insurance market What does this mean for Lloyds This is where I think Lloyds can help We can bring expertise to the new products and we can do that through reinsurance and by backing up domestic insurers Also diversifying reinsurance risks outside the country can help the domestic economy So in other words having a liberal insurance market is very important The Shanghai Insurance Exchange is in its early days We are supportive of it and we have agreed to become a member of it It will be very interesting to see how it develops What is the biggest challenge for Lloyds to navigate in the Chinese insurance market I think one of the biggest challenges is assessing risks in China As the economy changes there is a lack of data and a lack of history In other countries we have got good quality data which allow us to model risks more accurately As time goes on that will improve in China But at the moment it is still somewhat difficult as it is at a fairly early stage of development As times passes we will be able to collect the data and it will become easier for us to model the risk How would you define your management philosophy at Lloyds If you look at it as a soccer analogy we set out the football pitch we mow the grass we paint the lines and we make it as good a pitch as it could possibly be That is our philosophy What do you do in your free time I enjoy my family And I enjoy sailing I have been sailing since I was 15 I also like the arts and I am a trustee of the National Gallery in London lixiangchinadailycomcn China Daily European

worldwide demand for software When around 2000 enthusiastic Chinese app developers gathered for Google Incs annual conference in Beijing in December they didnt allow the subzero winter temperatures to chill their enthusiasm for the event Suitably impressed Scott Beaumont president of Google Greater China told the large audience on Beijing Google Developer Day the biggest such event in the AsiaPacific region that Google is here to know what Chinese developers want The rapturous crowd cheered him on Googles internet search engine may have been out of the Chinese mainland since 2010 but Google like other global tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft has ambitious plans for the worlds largest mobile internet market The Californiabased giant has launched a Chinese website for local app developers and promises help to take their products global The developments excite Yan Peng no end Finally its here This is the best Christmas gift for me I couldnt wait to ask for a day off to celebrate this moment the Shanghaibased app developer says Such gushing praise has been common among Chinese consumers at the launch of muchawaited gadgets like say the latest version of the iPhone But China is no longer just a humongous enduser market Apps developed in China are increasingly popular among domestic and overseas users For instance Clean Master a junkcleaning app has over 400 million overseas users Bigo Live a livestreaming app boasts 7 million monthly active users from Southeast Asian countries all of whom came on board within three months Apps developed in China abound these days Call China an appdeveloper hub if you will This new facet of China is not lost on the worlds tech giants China is now an indispensable part of the global developer community says Ben Galbraith head of product and developer relations at Googles developer product group Chinese developers are responsive to new technology and known for high efficiency The trend started a few years back In 2014 China nosed ahead of India in software development Out of 185 million professional and amateur software developers globally China accounted for 10 percent while India had 98 percent according to International Data Corp the US IT consultancy A picture of the current scene has yet to emerge but it is reasonable to assume that the mobile internet boom and Chinas digitalization push will likely have boosted the appdeveloper numbers significantly says Sandy Shen research director at Gartner Inc a USbased technology research and advisory company Sensing potential Apple has decided to set up a research and development center in Shenzhen Guangdong province later this year The US tech giants announcement came after it set up its first China RD center in Beijing in September The

Chuxing Chinese developers are already technologically strong and Apple will offer more help on the marketing side to help them venture into overseas markets Cook said at the time China remains key for Apple despite tumbling iPhone sales Thats because the country beat the US to become the largest market for Apples iOS app store last year according to App Annie an apptracker In the third quarter of 2016 Chinese consumers spent 17 billion at the iOS app store more than five times what they had spent just two years ago App Annie said in an email Encouraged Apple organized its firstever app developer competition in China in October to encourage university students to work on apps With spending rising and competition intensifying in the domestic market as a result Chinese app developers

the international stage last year Chinese novels came of age in 2016 bagging many international awards Childrens writer Cao Wenxuan won the Hans Christian Andersen Award Hao Jingfang took the Hugo Award following Liu Cixin the first Chinese winner of the award in 2015 and Wang Anyi grabbed the 2017 Newman Prize for Chinese Literature from the University of Oklahoma in September Veteran literary critic Meng Fanhua says the power of Chinese stories comes from the rural areas where we have the strongest literary traditions Books published in 2016 in English or Chinese clockwise from top left Deaths End by Liu Cixin Mercy by Lu Nei Ruined City by Jia Pingwa Flock of Brown Birds by Ge Fei The Cocoon by Zhang Yueran and Paper Hawk by Ge Liang Photos Provided to China Daily Another veteran critic Bai Ye from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences says that while traditional and established novel writers continue to produce works younger writers who were born in the 1970s 80s and 90s are also gaining ground Every year there are about 5000 novels published in the country But this year I noticed writers are more keen to reflect the pulse of society and their writings are close to everyday reality and easier for general readers to accept Bai who produces an annual report on Chinese novels adds that rural life is one of the key elements in the books published last year As urbanization expands the nostalgia for rural life grows as seen in Jia Pingwas work The Jihua Flower he says The novel about the plight of an abducted girl stirred a debate about gender equality soon after its release in March Other themes writers tackled last year were urban life and history It was also a trend for writers to personalize their take on history offering a touch of warmth to a cold past Bai says pointing to Mao Dun Literature Award winner Ge Feis Wang Chun Feng or The Spring Breeze as an example of this kind of work Wang Chun Feng is about a villages transformation as seen through the eyes of a young boy Giving other examples of these kinds of works Bai points to Fang Fangs Bare Burial a story about a lost family history during and after the countrys land reform and Lu Neis Mercy about a factory workers life before and after Chinas reform and openingup Another example is Hong Kongbased writer Ge Liang who was born in 1978 and his semibiographical referring to younger writers Bai says that those born in the 1980s are making a noticeable impression on their audiences Zhang Yueran made a mark with The Cocoon which is about two young people searching for the facts behind the disappearance of their fathers Online writer Tangjia Sanshao real name Zhang Wei also caught Bais attention with an autobiographical novel about how a selfmade writer achieved fame with help of his wife Online literature is offering more choices to readers It fills a blank in the Chinese book market says Shao Yanjun a web literature expert at Peking University who says he expects internet literature to be assimilated more into the mainstream Eight internet writers were elected to the national committee of the China Writers Association at the groups annual meeting in December Tangjia Sanshao was elected to the presidium of the association Explaining how internet literature is growing from strength to strength Shao says it has now become a major source of adaptation for movies and games and because of its large readership there is a spurt in the sales of TV and film rights of online works in China For instance The Interpreters a TV series based on a work by Miao Juan about the professional and love lives of two language translators attracted millions of viewers when it hit TV screens in May As for the money online writers are making Liu Chang who started writing science fiction novels fulltime in 2012 under the pen name Biting Dog says that the TV and film adaptation rights for his work Global Evolution is worth around 2 million yuan 300000 270000 euros 246500 Internet literature is becoming more diverse in terms of quality and topics says Peking Universitys Shao citing Zeng Dengke pen name Crazy Banana as a good example Zeng writes historical fantasy and tries to match classical literature Another significant trend noticed by Shao and her students is that Chinese internet literature is attracting Western readers who are also translating Chinese online novels into English on online forums such as Wuxiaworldcom The site was started by ChineseAmerican Lai Jingping known as RWX on the forum who quit a foreign service job to start the translation website As for literary genres that made it big last year scifi was near the top Wu Yan director of the Scifi Study Center at Beijing Normal University says he sees more attention being paid to the genre with a growing number of forums and campus seminars Even though Hugo Award winner Liu Cixin joked that Chinese scientists were keeping their distance from scifi writers Wu says the China Association for Science and Technology took many initiatives to use scifi to promote popular science to the public Its efforts included organizing the China SciFi Festival the first largescale scifi event in Beijing in September Moreover scifi works have begun to infiltrate classrooms which once dismissed such works Even startups are focusing on scifi he says But despite the good news for scifi in China I did not see too many good works produced in 2016 However despite his disappointment Wu recommended a few works Among his picks were young scifi writer Jiang Bo who recently finished the last installment of his trilogy The Heart of Galaxy which won the World Chinese Science Fiction Association prize Wu also recommended River of Time a work on time travel by 68yearold Wang Jinkang who has been writing science fiction for more than 20 years Other notable mentions included the works of overseas ChineseAmericans published in China such as short stories by scifi writer Ken Liu whose translations of the works of Liu Cixin and Hao Jingfang helped them win their Hugos Another ChineseAmerican who earned a mention was Karen Bao a graduate of Columbia University who recently published the first installment of her scifi series The Dove Chronicles in China On a more somber note 2016 was also the year when China lost two literary stars Chen Zhongshi

442,2017/1/13,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/13/content_27941604.htm,A dumpling for every season,Heres why jiaozi are consumed with gusto during so many Chinese holidays and festivals How do Chinese people celebrate festivals Even if you are not a China expert you might have been able to guess this one eating 饺子 jiǎozi thin pieces of dough with ground meat or vegetable filling steamed or boiled also known as dumplings In a country with a history of thousands of years and a diverse culinary culture its hard to imagine that such a commonplace item can be regarded as one of the countrys most representative dishes It can be said without exaggeration that at least in northern China not all over the country more on that later jiaozi plays an important role in almost half of Chinese festivals One should eat jiaozi at Chinese New Year the fifth day of the first month according to the lunar calendar the Autumn Commencement the Winter Commencement and the Winter Solstice As the Chinese saying goes Food is the god of the people Alternatively we can conclude that when foodies really want to eat something they can always find reasons The Chinese New Year Eating jiaozi on Chinese New Years Eve is the most important custom in northern China during Spring Festival Families get together around a table to wrap jiaozi together in the evenings and eat them at midnight Thats because according to ancient timekeeping customs a day was divided into 12 twohour periods and the period between 11 pm and 1 am was called 子时zǐsh�� or the Zi period On New Years Eve the Zi period marked the transition from an old year to a new year and had a special name 交子 jiāozǐ which sounded very similar to jiaozi Whats more the shape of a jiaozi is just like a gold yu��nbǎo 元宝 ingot an ancient currency so people eat jiaozi at the dinner with the wish that they will have prosperity in the new year Some cooks will hide a coin inside a jiaozi and whoever happens to find it is said to have good luck in the coming year The fifth day of the first month in the lunar calendar Just five days after New Years Eve people eat jiaozi again This custom is called breaking the fifth or 破五 pòwǔ because there are so many taboos during the Spring Festival period such as doing needlework breaking things getting your hair cut and so on However after the fifth day after the New Year those taboos dont exist anymore so people celebrate by eating jiaozi A special custom exists in the city of Tianjin and surrounding areas where people believe that when you wrap jiaozi you need to press the wrapper edges tightly so that people who like to talk about you behind your back will have their mouths zipped in the coming year The start of the Fu days The Fu days can be understood as the dog days of the Chinese summer which usually last 30 or 40 days between the traditional calendar seasons of Little Heat and Great Heat The first day of Fu is another jiaozi day Because the Fu days are the hottest time of the year people usually lack appetite so something delicious is needed to stimulate their taste buds Jiaozi a popular food that many people liked since ancient times became the optimal choice And because the Fu days took place during the start of harvest every household could afford the good meal The start of autumn When the high temperature that takes away peoples appetites finally drops cool autumn arrives and its definitely worth celebrating On the Autumn Commencement day of the lunar calendar it is believed people should eat something good especially meat to 贴秋��tiē qiūbiāo gain autumn weight because most people have lost some weight during the long hot summer and need to gain it back to stay healthy during the winter Of course for jiaozi lovers dumplings with meat filling works perfectly The start of winter When the weather is hot you eat jiaozi when its cold jiaozilovers will eat jiaozi too Eating jiaozi on the Winter Commencement day is one of the bestknown jiaozi customs in China and it is related to the origin of jiaozi Though there are many folk stories explaining how jiaozi was invented the most popular one was about the famous doctor Zhang Zhongjing Zhang was a great practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine who lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty 25220 One day in winter when Zhang was on his way home he found many poor people had frostbitten ears because they didnt have warm clothes and sufficient food Zhang tried to heal their ears He stewed lamb peppers and some medicine in a pot chopped them into small pieces and used them to fill small dough wrappers Zhang named these dumplings 娇��jiāoěr literally meaning tender ear and boiled them every day to feed his patients Gradually these patients became better and when Spring Festival came their ears were healed In order to express their gratitude to Zhang people began to imitate his recipe to make jiaoer which later became the current jiaozi and ate them to celebrate Spring Festival The winter solstice Chinese people have long placed a great deal of importance on the winter solstice Family members get together worship their ancestors and eat jiaozi Some claim the reason people eat jiaozi on this day is also to commemorate Zhang Zhongjing while others said its because of a goddess in ancient Chinese legend N��wa who is known for creating humans and repairing a great hole that one day appeared the sky It is said that N��wa existed at the beginning of the world and created humans by sculpting them with yellow clay But when she made ears for these humans she worried that the clay would freeze and the ears wouldnt stay attached to their heads when it became cold Therefore she pierced their ears and used a string to fix them to their heads So on the winter solstice which is the darkest and one of the coldest times of year people make and eat the earshaped jiaozi in memory of N��wa and its said if you dont eat jiaozi this day your ears will freeze and drop from your head Jiaozi lovers can always find a reason to eat jiaozi but the interesting thing is that it just happens in the north where there is a tradition of eating wheatbased food Southern people whose traditional dishes tend to be based more on rice are not crazy about it even though as more people migrate around the country for work and consume mass media such as CCTVs documentary about jiaozi as the ultimate Chinese festival food the northern customs are becoming better known and even adopted by some southerners However traditionally southerners had other choices for festivals At Spring Festival they eat tangyuan or fried niangao traditional dishes made from sticky rice on the winter solstice they eat tangyuan for Lantern Festival they of course also eat tangyuan There are also dishes special to certain regions other winter solstice foods for instance include fried sticky rice consumed in the Jiangnan region ninelayer rice cakes and soy flourcovered sweet round cakes made of glutinous rice paste in parts of the southeastern coast and Taiwan noodles and pumpkin patties in Anhui province and mutton soup in Shandong After all China is a vast land so to designate one dish as the official festival food would probably lead to a civil war but at least we can agree that the holidays are the perfect excuse to binge on all your favorite dishes Courtesy of The World of Chinese

444,2017/1/13,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/13/content_27941602.htm,A dish full of history,Editors note To understand China sit down to eat Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture It is a dish full of history and there are about as many myths and legends attached to it as there are ingredients in the recipe Unlike many Chinese classics for the dinner table this one has no fancy title It is simply known as pencai or dish in a basin The name reflects the presentation Layers of food are stacked on top of one another in a large serving pot or basin To find out why we need to hark back to its origins The layerings of meat and vegetables provide a delicate harmony of taste and texture Photos by Chuai Meitu For China Daily Many versions of how this dish came about are floating around the wild blue yonder of the internet but the elements are largely the same as the story my mother told me when I first tasted pencai in Hong Kong decades ago The story involved a fugitive king or general washed up on the shores of either Shenzhen or Hong Kong cold hungry and in need of the kindness of strangers The strangers were variously fishermen or village folk depending on which version of the story one prefers Out of sympathy and respect the common folk brought out the best ingredients they had in their homes and cooked for their downandout visitor They were so poor they didnt have enough spare crockery for guests so the food was served from a wooden basin One thing everyone agreed on was the Hakka element The Hakka are the guest people emigrants from the Central Plains who settled in the coastal provinces of the south notably Fujian and Guangdong In Hong Kong they built villages surrounded by low enclosures called weicun or walled villages In neighboring Shenzhen they formed fishing communities and also settled in the hills of nearby Meizhou There is historical evidence that the royal refugee would most likely have been hosted by a Hakka community The Hakka are famous to this day for their pencai which is eaten on festive occasions such as birthdays weddings and on the eve of the lunar new year during the reunion dinner It is a masterpiece of cooking skill and frugality with expert layering of ingredients that sound contradictory but actually provide a delicate harmony of taste and texture At the very bottom of the large basin is a layer of braised radish a root vegetable that withstands long cooking and readily absorbs the juices of meat and seafood On top of the radish is usually braised pork belly its rich fat leaching down to nourish the radishes The pork may be topped with fried tofu or gluten balls which again soak up the fatty meat juices and act as a soft barrier for the next layer Roast duck or steamed chicken on top of the tofu or gluten adds distinctive flavor and texture especially duck whose fat lends a special fragrance to the dish The next layer again vegetables is likely to be thick slices of yam or taro chosen for the ability to complement meat The layering will go on alternating meat seafood and vegetables until the chef runs out of imagination and ingredients Generally the best ingredients are displayed on the very top and some pencai may even see the luxurious addition of dried scallops whole abalones or sea cucumber Other ingredients used may include dried oysters prawns fish maw crab fish cakes or meatballs In fact the pencai may be assembled from very economical items not just expensive exclusive treats Pencai is popular in Huaiyang cuisine as well a cooking style that is quickly gaining popularity in China for its lighter natural flavors It has traveled far from its YangzhouHuaian roots and is now often served at state banquets including dinners served at the Great Hall of the People A senior colleague from Yangzhou says the Huaiyang version of pencai also has the characteristic layerings of meat and vegetables What makes it different is that it will have two very Huaiyang ingredients danjiao and fish meatballs Danjiao are dumplings made with an egg skin Beaten egg is poured into a heated ladle and swirled until slightly set A spoonful of filling is added and the dumpling is quickly folded over The dumplings are laid out in rows in the pencai to fully cook Fish meatballs are equally laborious to make The filleted meat of the freshest fish is scraped and minced and beaten together until it forms a light white cloud With a dexterous squeeze and twist a meatball is formed and dropped into boiling water The finished meatballs are then added to the pencai Huaiyang cuisine only uses sea cucumber to top the dish and skips the abalone The dish has also been duplicated in the north where its known as quanjiafu or family reunion However the ingredients may be more roughandready and it may lose some of its southern finesse The romance of the dish seems to fade as it travels paulinedchinadailycomcn A popular dish for Spring Festival reunions A new culinary phenomenon that has surfaced in recent years is the hotel hamper for Spring Festival In many ways it is like the traditional Christmas hamper minus the turkey or ham It also reflects the changing lifestyle of many urban Chinese A series of family meals is a traditional part of the festivities starting with the reunion dinner on New Years Eve The first day of the Chinese New Year sees another gathering of family and friends and the feasting may go on for a week While in the past a battalion of mothers aunts and sisters would be churning out dishes from the kitchen it is getting increasingly likely that food may be ordered in This is where the hotel hampers come in with their gifts of cakes buns and a large readytoheat pot of pencai an ideal dish for such occasions All you need to do is to reheat the pot on a low fire and wait until the ingredients are again warm and bubbling Cooking time is minimal because the dish has been prepared in advance And its ready mix of seafood meat and vegetables is a luxurious and impressive treat for all China Daily European Weekly 01132017

446,2017/1/13,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/13/content_27941600.htm,The big picture,Illustrators struggle to draw attention to the value of their work Twoandahalf millennia after Confucius said that one seeing is worth a hundred hearings some bright spark in the Englishspeaking world took a leaf out of the great sages book and came up with a picture is worth a thousand words The West gave birth last century to an industry that employs millions of people who provide illustrations for books cataloges advertising and other media And yet somewhere along the way in China the old message seems to have been overlooked Only in recent years has the printed picture begun to make an impact as a medium par excellence for getting messages across in many different areas Childrens picture books have been growing in popularity in the past few years Xu han inset one of the artists who caters to this genre created the iconic character Ali Photos Provided to China Daily One of the drawings by Zhang Yunbao an editor and illustrator of childrens picture books One of those who is aware of how far China has lagged behind but is now seeing it making strides to catch up is Zhang Yunbao 29 a childrens picture book editor for Beijing Poplar Culture Project Co In her free time she draws commercial illustrations and makes her own picture books Zhang has worked in the field for five years and says she has noticed that in the past two years demand for both commercial illustrations and childrens picture books has begun to take off which holds the prospect of a much bigger market in coming years You can see that illustrations are increasingly wanted by online shops clothing brands cellphone brands and booths in shopping malls Over each of the past 10 years sales of childrens picture books have grown by an average of 10 to 12 percent in China says Hou Mingliang founder of IlluSalon an organization founded in Beijing in 2014 to promote the use of illustrations in China and bring together illustrators and customers Hou has worked in childrens book publishing for eight years As China fulfils its mission of ensuring that most of its citizens are clothed fed and feeling welloff materially the public is developing an appetite for intellectual and spiritual nourishment that only education and the arts such as music literature and painting can give he says Li Ajiu 32 a freelance illustrator in Shanghai says that just 10 years ago when she graduated from university illustrated books were hard to come by in China but now they are everywhere That is partly because parents have come to accept the concept of picture books she says Hou says Picture books with beautiful illustrations good stories and creative storytelling will exert great influence on children who construct the world and connect themselves with society through them So good picture books are very important However 85 percent of childrens picture books are imported and only 15 percent are domestic creations Hou says Chinese parents prefer to buy imported picture books for their children because the values reflected in the stories are expressed in more creative ways and the quality is generally better than that of domestic works he says And for publishing houses goodquality imported picture books particularly ones that have won awards are safer in the market Some people attribute this to the longer history of the illustration tradition in Europe and the United States which cultivate highly talented illustrators Hou and Zhang say many other factors are hampering the growth of the domestic illustration industry Zhang can recall few cases in which those who have ordered illustrations from her have offered a contract for her to sign In most cases the only communication is by email and without legal protection some illustrators have to fight to get paid even after their work has been used Apart from requiring artistic talent and training creating an illustration is timeconsuming and most illustrators who have not made a name for themselves struggle to survive on meager earnings In fact many of Zhangs illustrator friends say trying to make a living from their art is out of the question They all love painting but they have to live she says Han Dan 28 an illustrator who is known on the internet as Ghost Master is an editor at Chemical Industry Press in Beijing The lethargic growth in the publication of original picture books in China is partly the result of a dearth of picture book editors in publishing houses and elsewhere she says Zhang says Apart from illustrators most people do not know about illustrations what kind of illustrators they need or what kind of creative styles they want People in other fields know little about art and painting For Han another problem is the limited scope that illustrators have for selling their work In China picture books are mainly for children and that means illustrators have a very limited space in which to express themselves Hou says that in Europe illustrations were originally created by people to express their ideas or imagination on canvas Some of the more personal illustrations that carried the wisdom of older generations may have been shown to the young as a means of education He cites The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter saying that Potter originally just painted for herself without thinking about publishing But after she showed the stories to a friend he encouraged her to publish them Peter Rabbit then became a popular picture book which has become a classic Many European illustrators draw very personal stories and then have them published Hou says Han has rarely drawn commercial illustrations because they usually dont like my style which is cool not that kind of warm or light style She has been working intermittently on stories about ghosts living in another world I have talked to people on an online illustration platform Obviously what they are looking for are illustrations for children books so for them weird or cold dark themes and colors are out I know some Chinese illustrators who are really good You may say they lack creativity compared with people in Europe or the United States but thats because they cannot express themselves fully To gauge the quality of illustrations in a certain country you have to see the general level of the illustrators not just a few of the top ones Hou says Maybe this is going to offend some people but the average level of Chinese illustrators is low Many are just craftspeople who are good at technique but lack the quality to become masters because they dont have a big enough reserve of culture including literature music and painting Chinas arts education is twisted Students who go to fine art academies are usually those who may not be able to enter general universities Ideas are most important for illustrations and the images are secondary So there is still a long way to go Nowadays Chinese people on average read no more than five books annually compared with more than 60 in Israel College teacher Xu Han creates stories about Ali the popular red fox Now he is directing a movie about the character He says that when he creates the picture books the biggest challenge he faces is writing good stories rather than getting the painting technique right The core of a picture book is the story To write a good story you have to build up a big collection of ideas from everyday life he says The task that illustrators or designers face covers more than just artistic technique and form It also entails trying to express oneself through the content Xu says Zhang says that when she was deciding which university to attend her father who always encouraged her to chase her dreams suggested that she should go to a comprehensive university rather than a special one When I was little my father told me to find the thing I really love and pursue it as a career Of course academies of fine arts have their advantages with better faculties and richer artistic perspectives for students My father said I know you love painting but at an academy of fine arts you will be surrounded by nothing but arts If you go to a comprehensive university there are various kinds of things you can learn about which I think is better for your development I personally believe that illustrators need to care about more than painting things such as literature movies theater photography or child psychology You also need to know about society These things are connected Luo Qianxi 26 a freelance illustrator in Beijing says Chinas illustration industry lacks organizations or agencies that can help creators promote their works Illustrators spend most of their time and energy on creation They dont know how to find customers or promote themselves On the other hand there are many welldeveloped organizations and agencies in Europe that help illustrators promote themselves and find customers They also have good platforms to sell their works Luo says In addition in Europe people generally are more familiar with the illustration industry and often support and respect illustrators works she says In China piracy is also a big problem says Xia Mengyu another freelance illustrator However Hou believes that in the future illustrations will become mainstream in China and even part of everyday life They will appear everywhere and people will use them to decorate their houses or to promote their products he says Good works will be collected and stored This is an audiovisual era and the day will come soon yangyangchinadailycomcn China Daily European Weekly 01132017 page16

454,2017/1/13,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/13/content_27941590.htm,2017 bodes well for Chinese takeovers,New approach sees buyers opting for longterm brand enhancement rather than an overeager grab for profits Now that we have entered 2017 it may be easier to review dispassionately the business year behind and to look ahead In doing so a more pragmatic view goes beyond the muchhyped macro indicators of gross domestic product and the consumer price index Most significant throughout 2016 was the number and size of foreign takeovers by Chinese companies The total value of Chinese mergers and acquisitions of foreign companies reached a record 2472 billion 2343 billion euros 2015 billion in 2016 If this figure is not staggering enough then how about the yearonyear percentage increase which stands at an amazing 142 percent Before discussing key deals that took place last year and then looking ahead at what to expect throughout 2017 the changing nature of these takeovers needs highlighting Takeovers involving raw material purchases and other supplies that are needed to fuel factory production now represent a far smaller percentage of Chinese acquisition activity The focus now is much more on consumer branding and the technological knowhow needed to fuel domestic consumption It is now estimated that this new approach set to continue as Chinas economy continues its transition from lowcost production and exporting to domestic consumption of premium brands accounts for approximately 50 percent of all Chinese company takeovers of foreign brands Last year also highlighted major change in a variety of industries now targeted by Chinese companies in their foreign firm acquisition strategies Even more significantly last year witnessed the further emergence of privately owned Chinese companies planting a firm footprint on the international MA scene Going back only as far as 2013 Chinese takeover deals were heavily dominated by the stateowned sector which typically went on the hunt for copper mines in Africa iron ore producers in Australia and major players in the Canadian energy sector Europe is now very much the focus of increasingly ambitious and entrepreneurial privately owned Chinese enterprises with recent acquisitions of French fashion houses Italian football teams and UK luxury brands From finance to food and fashion to football the increasing variety of industries targeted has been more than matched by the increasing amounts invested in huge takeovers of foreign companies and their branded products by Chinese companies Last year saw the largest takeover to date by a Chinese company of a foreign firm In August Chinese chemical giant ChemChina secured the acquisition of Swiss pesticide and seed producer Syngenta for a formidable 43 billion 53 billion 50 billion euros The European focus for Chinese takeover targets last year also saw Tencent part of the increasingly dominant Chinese internet sector splash out almost 9 billion in July on Finnish mobile game development company Supercell easily Tencents largest foreign takeover so far Acquisitions by Chinese firms across Europe last year totaled a whopping 765 billion comfortably the largest merger and acquisition investment sum compared with the Americas and Asia Companies from Western Europe and Germany in particular appear to stand out as the favored targets for takeover Further examination of Chinese company merger and acquisition activity last year reveals a far more mature professional approach in which takeover targets were screened with the utmost scrutiny before the launch of any takeover bid Takeovers are also seen increasingly as partner brands where considerable care is taken in postacquisition integration They are not simply public trophies But will this Chinese companyled and Europeanfocused MA spree continue throughout 2017 In short the answer is not only a resounding yes but even greater growth could take place Here are some of the reasons behind what could be another record year for Chinese company takeovers US President Trump Despite huge uncertainty over the soontobe appointed president it is clear that the US economy could become far less open for business with the outside world Asia and China in particular This could leave Europe already the clearly favored target for overseas expansion by Chinese companies an even more attractive place Europes attractiveness is further enhanced when the likely industry targets for Chinese companies are considered Top among the most highprofile takeovers last year are fashion football finance and technology and major Western European economies offer a rich supply of established global brands in each of these areas For example Europe boasts three of the four widely recognized fashion capitals in the world London Paris and Milan Consequentially many of the top global fashion brands are European Chinese investment in football clubs really took off last year For example Chinese consumer electronics retailer Suning bought a majority stake in Italian football giant Inter Milan in June last year for 307 million and one of the biggest English football clubs Aston Villa also became Chinese owned Further forays into the mostdeveloped football leagues around the world is highly likely and once again European football dominates The English Premier League the German Bundesliga and the French Ligue1 as well as the Italian Serie A and the Spanish La Liga contain many of the most highly valued football clubs in the world Europes financial sector will also continue to prove attractive to potential Chinese investors Takeovers in Europes ailing banking sector are seen as far less politically sensitive than the US banking industry Global technology brands muchcoveted by Chinese industry as a vital aid in their modernization efforts can also be found in abundance across Europe This goes some way to explaining the attractiveness of German industries as potential takeover targets German companies and the German government continue to welcome investment from China and Chinese companies appreciate just how much the adoption of the most advanced technologies in their industry will improve their competitiveness Of course there are concerns that too much outbound investment may lead to government attempts to curb activities in order to protect the currency But such concerns do not stand up to scrutiny Further transition toward the adoption across Chinese industry of a highinvestment highquality and premium branding business culture will not happen if any kind of currency reliance continues It is therefore unlikely that currency concerns will lead to a limitation of overseas involvement by Chinese companies especially in acquisition activity So what should European businesses make of this inexorable influx of takeovers by Chinese companies and how might they actually benefit Crucial for European business has been the changing approach toward takeover targets by Chinese firms and the postacquisition process In both case partnerships and a longterm perspective appear to have usurped the previously overeager shortterm acquisitive attitude of Chinese companies Chinese companies and their leaders are no longer trophy hunting when it comes to takeovers of European businesses and their brands Instead they increasingly see growth via foreign brand acquisition as part of a clear sustainable growth strategy where longterm market share and customer satisfaction trump without trouble any shortterm financial objectives Chinese companies while keen to learn from their European takeover targets also appear to accept that established global brands should be left as individual product brands with no or little public association between the brand and its new corporate owner During 2017 and beyond therefore European brands could benefit substantially from Chinese corporate takeover investment which if last years MA activities are indicative of future activity should be seen as muchneeded fuel for brand building The author is a visiting professor at the University of

Chinese conductor Hong Xia had her most memorable birthday in January last year when she led the Chinese Traditional Orchestra of the China National Opera Dance Drama Theater in performances at the KKL in Lucerne Switzerland during the orchestras European tour At the end of rehearsals Wu Jiatong CEO of Wu Promotion the private promoter in China that organized the 2016 tour stepped onto the stage with cake and flowers wishing Hong a happy birthday and congratulating the orchestra I totally forgot my birthday Hong recalls When Wu walked to me I thought he was going to give a short speech I was really surprised From Left Musicians from Chinese Traditional Orchestra of the China National Opera Dance Drama Theater and Swiss audience at the Culture and Convention Centre Lucerne in Switzerland Wu Jiatong first left CEO of Wu Promotion Remy Pagani second left mayor of the City of Geneva Lorella Bertani center in gray suit president of the Board of the Grand Theatre de Geneve with representitives from the Chinese orchestra Photos Provided to China Daily What made Hong even more excited was that the KKL or Culture and Convention Centre Lucerne was the same venue where the late conductor Claudio Abbado 19332014 gave his final concerts Abbado was one of my favorite conductors in the world and I was honored to perform there says Hong a 1982 graduate of Shenyang Conservatory of Music The concert turned out to be a great success with a full house of more than 2000 giving the orchestra a lengthy ovation On Jan 27 Hong will lead the musicians in a performance at the KKL again as part of a new European tour which will kick off on Jan 16 in Budapest Hungary After KKL they will travel to Erl Austria on Jan 29 I thought the main audience for a traditional Chinese folk music concert would be overseas Chinese I didnt expect that the majority of the audience would be Westerners she says Their warm feedback was very encouraging and we are looking forward to our upcoming shows The 2017 program will feature wellknown music pieces including The Great Wall Capriccio Erhu Concerto by Chinese composer Liu Wenjin 19372013 and Lingering Snow on The Broken Bridge composed by Liu Xijin in which a solo flutist performs with the folk orchestra The orchestra is one of four national Chinese folk music orchestras that will tour abroad during the upcoming Chinese Spring Festival period with the support of Wu Promotion Titled the Grand Chinese New Year Concert the tour will involve more than 300 Chinese musicians from the China National Opera Dance Drama Theater the Guangdong National Orchestra of China the Zhejiang Traditional Orchestra and the Shaanxi Broadcasting Chinese Orchestra They will visit 27 cities in 14 countries including Kazakhstan Russia Poland Hungary Austria Germany Switzerland Finland and the United Kingdom According to Wu each performance will open with an introduction showing the uniqueness of traditional Chinese instruments The idea is to enable Western audiences to better understand the music The Grand Chinese New Year Concert is our oldest brand It will celebrate its 20th anniversary next year says Wu who founded Wu Promotion with his father in 1991 The company currently produces more than 500 concerts and events annually in China and abroad The company recently wrapped up a Cuba tour by the China Philharmonic Orchestra which featured performances on Dec 15 and 16 Besides the Grand Chinese New Year Concert one of the bestknown projects is the annual Peking Opera Festival which celebrated its eighth year in the Darwin Entertainment Centre Australia from Nov 29 to Dec 1 Wu recalls the first concert in the Vienna Musikverein in 1998 with the orchestra under the baton of conductor Chen Xieyang Tickets sold out and even the stairs in the venue were occupied by audience members That was an unexpected success Since then weve made the Grand Chinese New Year Concert an annual event to display our traditional folk music to foreign audiences says Wu who was born in Beijing and pursued his music studies in Austria So far the grand concert has attracted about 300000 concertgoers in some 20 countries Presenting music with such instruments as the horseheaded fiddle from Inner Mongolia as well as Cantonese melodies from the gaohu a string instrument played with a bow 13 Chinese folk music orchestras have performed as part of the project The tour has stopped in Switzerland most frequently In 2006 Wu Promotion brought China Traditional Orchestra Zhejiang to perform at the KKL in Lucerne under the baton of conductor Zhang Guoyong It also visited five German cities and then went to Vienna Amsterdam Alexandria and Cairo Wu says Swiss Television provided six hours of coverage for the event including broadcasting the concert and presenting documentaries about traditional Chinese musicians and their instruments More than 2000 people saw the show in person and even more were exposed via television to the great variety of sounds and musical instruments less known in the Western world Since then Wu Promotion has brought many Chinese orchestras and art troupes to perform in Switzerland The company has also brought Swiss art troupes to China including the Grand Theatre de Geneve Ballet Company which toured China in April Wu Promotion has a threeyear plan to bring the established Lucerne Festival to Shanghai from 2018 to 2020 The festival is a summer music event held annually in Switzerland Founded in 1938 it is known for presenting famous orchestras legendary conductors and celebrated soloists During the 7th Peking Opera Festival which was held in Geneva Switzerland last year the president of Grand Theater de Geneva Tobias Richter discussed with Wu the idea of moving Opera des Nations to China after June 2018 Grand Theater de Geneva built in 1876 is the largest opera house in the Frenchspeaking area of Switzerland Due to renovations that have been in progress for more than two years a large woodconstruction theater was purchased from France for temporary use The temporary theater which served as a venue for La ComedieFrancaise during its own renovation was resettled in Geneva The structure was expanded and revived under the name of Opera de Nations The city of Geneva has agreed to gift the structure to China as a token of friendship in the long history of close ties between China and Geneva This will be a historic event for both China and Switzerland and it will serve as a cultural bond between the two countries says Wu I fully support this transfer of the Theatre des Nations from Geneva to Beijing two cities already linked by a thriving partnership It would represent one more excellent opportunity to increase and further deepen the relations between our two countries says JeanJacques de Dardel Swiss ambassador to China This gift from Switzerland to China will allow many Swiss artists musicians orchestras and dancers to perform for the Chinese public and strengthen the cultural ties between our two people in a structure representing the best in sustainable building methods The fact that this theater could be rebuilt in Beijing the capital

vital role collaboration must play for us to best navigate the future This year British Telecommunications Plc will celebrate 180 years since the filing of the first patent for the fiveneedle electric telegraph an innovation that laid the earliest foundations for todays connected world and which underpins the fourth industrial revolution The inventors of that device Charles Wheatstone a scientist and William Fothergill Cooke an entrepreneur worked together to turn a great idea into what eventually became a global industry If I think about innovations from BTs history almost all were collaborative efforts From the first live TV transmission across the Atlantic a collaboration between ATTs Bell Labs and BT Labs to the work were doing today on the next generation of ultrafast broadband technologies the biggest successes have resulted from experts in different fields working together to achieve a common goal Thats why companies today are increasingly taking a global open innovation approach A major risk for large organizations even ones such as ours who invest extensively in RD is the not invented here syndrome the chance that disruptive technologies will be ignored because theyre not pioneered in your own labs BTs innovation scouting teams and university partnerships in the UK Silicon Valley the MIT tech cluster Abu Dhabi China and other strategic locations around the world give us a global view bringing the most innovative technologies into our business wherever they originate Collaboration between business and academia is a key component of open innovation As were gathering for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum lets take a Swiss example of collaboration CERN with its 2500 staff from 22 member states The birthplace of the World Wide Web CERN provides a global community of scientists with access to powerful facilities for experimentation research data processing and analysis In 2013 the combination of these great minds and worldleading facilities in tunnels not far from Davos proved the existence of the Higgs boson or God particle a fundamental building block of the universe Theres a significant contingent of British brains involved in CERN Britain is a melting pot of science and industry and in a postBrexit world the UK will need to capitalize on its worldleading universities and build an innovationled economy that lays a powerful foundation for future growth Helping universities to focus their research and enormous intellectual capital on areas that have the potential for the creation of worldleading intellectual property is a role that businesses like ours increasingly need to step up to Sustainable future growth needs purposeful innovation that is socially and commercially relevant At a global level we see how things like the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement need to apply a collaborative and open approach to transcend national and political boundaries and develop innovative solutions to the big global issues of our time extreme poverty inequality and climate change And every day we see examples of the collective power of people using social media When used responsibly this can be a force for good supporting people in need and improving the state of the world The first social media platforms were born of a few creative and collaborative minds less than a decade ago They have since been adopted by billions of people and continue to evolve in their form and function In 2016 Major Tim Peake Britains first astronaut used social media to bring the enormity of space closer to millions of schoolchildren in the UK and around the world The International Space Station which he visited is one of the most ambitious international collaborations ever attempted and the most politically complex space exploration program ever undertaken The largest space station ever constructed it continues to be assembled in orbit and to date has been visited by astronauts of nearly 20 nationalities who make use of its research laboratories to improve our understanding of the world around us So whether we look to the inky blackness of the sky or somewhere closer to home we see time and again the power of the exchange of ideas and of working together across boundaries Chance favors the connected mind fortune favors the brave In our modern world responsive and responsible business leaders need to create environments where ideas can connect and people can collaborate The author is the Chief Executive of BT Group The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily

458,2017/1/13,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/13/content_27941576.htm,A glimpse of the future,Amid global uncertainties not least a new US presidency China plots a steady course of continued progress and reform President Xi Jinping is set to make a case defending globalization at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos He will make clear the worlds secondlargest economys commitment to being a key driver of world trade The theme of the forum which runs from Jan 17 to 20 is Responsive and Responsible Leadership Klaus Schwab founder and executive chairman of the Genevabased international organization welcomed Chinas involvement China is an emerging superpower and we expect the country to play an increasingly active role as a responsive and responsible global leader he says Areas where we are already seeing this happen include catalyzing support for protecting the environment acting as a champion for international trade and investment supporting development and infrastructure finance and moving to develop and expand the global digital economy Despite increasing fears of protectionism economic ties can continue to flourish between industrializing Asia and developed Europe On Chinas part everyone agrees that some big challenges remain Trump provocations or political distractions domestic debt or capital outflow to court potentially high returns from the overseas mainly American markets The Central Economic Work Conference held in Beijing in midDecember was used to deal with exactly these challenges Chinas toplevel decisionmakers hold such a conference each December to map out development strategies and targets for the next year Key targets will not be revealed until they are proposed to the National Peoples Congress in early March when targets become official But enough information can be obtained by China business watchers from the communique of the Central Economic Work Conference which is in effect a carefullyworded statement of all major strategies for the next year Some overseas commentators said what they read from the communique was a general approach of putting stability first and reform second leaving the impression that Beijing will never muster enough resolve even though its leaders have made great strides in building a more solid power base through an unprecedented anticorruption campaign over the past few years China has to take necessary precautions in reform A lot of time is needed because it is a completely different game for local officials who began their careers when GDP and almost nothing else served as the measure of their performance In 2017 stability is still important if not even more so now that a change in the US administration and its possible China policy are bringing in an additional sense of uncertainty But stability doesnt mean a standstill or no change Reform wont stop even if it cant proceed by leaps and bounds as it did in earlier days such as when the special economic zones were just being launched in the 1980s That was a time when Chinas per capita GDP was only around 300 Now it is 8200 What is in the nations best interest is to progress with reform amid stability Stability is guarantee for reform The ongoing cleangovernment movement requires more than frequent reports and checks on officials conduct in office and with public funds They are also expected to carry out more economic tasks than just enlarging the local GDP In the nations 13th FiveYear Plan 201620 rigorous targets are set for social development and environmental protection Some economic targets do not even require growth in numbers One example is the task assigned two years ago and yet to be completed to slash industrial capacity most noticeably the closure of some steel mills It is aimed at helping the worlds steelmakers and reducing pollution As serious readers will realize the communique said 2017 will be a more demanding year for reform Cutting excessive industrial capacity inventory borrowing operational costs and whatever shortcomings exist in management and production is a task to be continued from 2016 New tasks abound One area to watch is reform of the publicprivate partnership scheme sometimes called the mixedownership scheme in stateowned enterprises It is something that China has been talking about for the last few years but since being included in the top leaders 60point decision on reform in 2013 it has been put into practice in only a small number of pilot projects as with all reform programs in their initial stage There were rumors that an overall PPP program was being drawn up for some nationallevel large SOEs But as the Chinese like to say conditions were still not quite right for introducing PPP nationwide By contrast in 2017 according to the communique some concrete steps will be taken in industries ranging from power generation and grid oil and gas railways airlines telecommunications and defense systems Although accomplishment of the whole PPP program is likely to take a few years once implemented it will amount to a second remaking of the Chinese SOE system after its first major reform in the early 1990s overseen by the premier Zhu Rongji Even amid the bold changes of Zhus time having private investment in defense companies was beyond anyones imagination Apart from the abovementioned changes progress is planned in many areas In general it features two things One is the domestic and the other the legal side of economic reform especially protection of the property rights of companies and private citizens Thanks to all the efforts since the 2008 global crisis to maintain stability while seeking development China has developed a more balanced economic system Its focus has grown from chasing everfaster growth to building a lasting institution The Central Economic Work Conference also pledged new efforts including In agricultural reforms to focus on the definition and protection of land rights In industrial reforms to focus on boosting innovation and helping small and mediumsized enterprises In the real estate market to restrict speculative investment in urban residential housing units In the regional development strategy to focus on the countrys existing key urban belts In the economic legal system to strengthen the protection of property rights and redress wrong court rulings in this regard In the financial system to clarify fiscal interests and responsibilities between the central and local governments while making regulation more effective in the financial market Of course the Central Economic Work Conference has painted a farfromdetailed picture of business in China in 2017 It is a framework in which policies and the methods of their implementation can be adjusted according to conditions and possibilities But the framework is expected to remain stable It is especially important when in all likelihood Chinas international environment will deteriorate if the Trump administration acts as its boss repeatedly pledged during his election campaign As some observers say what the world will see from the Trump administration will not be a simple version of isolationism but unilateralism Other economies as a result may feel pressured to take initiatives by themselves instead of counting on the US market More than ever before China will have to depend on its own economy for growth But just as Marcus Aurelius said time is everyones equal possession While Trump plays his own unilateral game other countries can also develop their games Four years is not a short time as long as there isnt a major disaster It is enough for China to make changes and come out stronger as a more resourceful business partner for all

462,2017/1/13,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/13/content_27941571.htm,Calm voice emerges from global turmoil,Academic believes Chinese president could be a stable influence at Davos as world events bring waves of uncertainty Rana Mitter believes President Xi Jinping could offer a voice for stability in an uncertain world at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos The director of the Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre says Xis attendance at the summit the first by a Chinese head of state could signal the global order does not need to change despite Donald Trump assuming office on Jan 20 I think Xis attendance could be interpreted as a vote of confidence by China in the current global order which in 2017 may be sorely needed Clearly last year was a bruising year he says Rana Mitter director of the Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre says President Xi Jinpings attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year could signal that the global order does not need to change despite Donald Trump assuming office on Jan 20 Nick JB Moore For China Daily If you think of all the things that Davos stands for it is about the maintenance of the liberal economic order and broadly speaking a quite progressive sort of social system too President Xis decision to be at this years summit comes after the attendance of VicePresident Li Yuanchao last year and Premier Li Keqiang in 2015 China has also held its own Summer Davos annually since 2007 under the auspices of the WEF alternating between host cities Tianjin and Dalian Mitter who was speaking in the front room of his Oxford home believes that given Chinas engagement with Davos Xis keynote address to the forum is likely to carry extra significance The Chinese president is set to reaffirm his commitment to globalization and free trade at the meeting I think a lot of people will be listening very carefully to what he has to say It is likely to make more of a splash this year than it would have done a year ago The world 12 months ago was really very different in terms of what was happening and any likely expectations Davos has come to symbolize the global elite bringing together politicians heads of think tanks and large corporations leading economists academics and the media It is this elite that has come under fire from populist movements that have led to the election of Donald Trump in the US and the UKs Brexit decision Mitter 47 and regarded as one of the leading China experts in the West believes voters should not fool themselves into thinking they are being offered anything other than a different form of elite What is mostly happening is that one elite is being replaced by another Donald Trump has articulated the voices of many people who are clearly desperately unhappy with their current economic situation but it is not as if he himself is a hornyhanded son of toil who has worked his way up through the coal mines An awful lot of the antielites who are themselves elites of a different sort are offering supposed solutions that have very little substance to them whatsoever One of the main discussion points at Davos is the risk of returning to a 1930sstyle era of protectionism Presidentelect Trump threatened during his election campaign to impose a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese goods This strikes me as highly unlikely in practice says Mitter China famously and the US are in the World Trade Organization which exists precisely to try and prevent this sort of trade war escalating The idea that the US and China can simply launch a trade war against each other without outside intervention does not reflect the reality of the situation There are an awful lot of other actors who would have something to say about this including the European Union Canada Australia and the UK once it leaves the EU of course Climate change is also likely to be high on the agenda at Davos with the hardwon agreement drawn up at the 2015 Paris summit which both China and the US ratified seemingly under threat from the new US administration He hasnt actually said he will abandon it Like many other things when you peruse the grammar very carefully he has allowed himself more wriggle room than is immediately clear from the rhetoric adds Mitter It wouldnt actually be that easy to simply dump the climate change deal because by doing so he would be dumping every single one of Americas allies who have also signed up for it He will be aware there will be a price to pay for that as well The future of the European Union will be another debating point at the Swiss ski resort The UK is set to invoke Article 50 at the end of March which will trigger the start of Brexit negotiations The French have their general election in May with Front National leader Marine Le Pen likely to get into the final round of voting and with a chance of winning the presidency If Le Pen does win that will put a bomb under the structures of the European Union I think it would put an end to the great European project at least in its current form says Mitter The academic says that even if conservative candidate Francois Fillon is elected in France and Angela Merkel is returned in Germany the EU still faces major uphill challenges It still has the euro crisis it still has the Italian banks problem and it still has relatively sluggish growth Its structural problems will not have been resolved Mitter the son of academics originally from West Bengal studied Chinese at Cambridge and was a Kennedy scholar at Harvard before embarking on an academic career He has written a number of books on China including the highly acclaimed Chinas War With Japan 193745 The Struggle for Survival which has been translated into Chinese He combines being director of the Oxford University China Centre which he is contracted to until 2019 with being a presenter of the BBC Radio 3 arts program Free Thinking Mitter who attended Davos last year as a speaker believes another of the major talking points there will be the future of US foreign policy under the new administration A preTrump America or any other president would be concerned about things such as security in Europe I suspect there is at least some part of the Trump administration that really doesnt regard that as a first level American priority he says The future of trade within Asia itself will also be debated The incoming president has already announced he will withdraw the US from the TransPacific Partnership Some have suggested that China may want to form its own alternative bloc possibly built around RCEP Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership an ASEAN Association of Southeast Asian Nations initiative Mitter however believes that President Xi would much prefer to form a trading bloc that included the United States rather than going it alone Im totally convinced by the idea that China would much rather have the US inside whatever structure it is The academic maintains that Xi is likely to provide a reassuring presence at Davos in a world of change Klaus Schwab founder and executive chairman of the Genevabased international organization has already said the president will outline his countrys evolving role in the new global structure Chinese politics is probably likely to be much more predictable and stable during 2017 certainly compared to an untried US President the start of Brexit negotiations and the structural problems of the European Union All of these are the political unknowns that will begin to unfold over the next 12 months

manufacturing to a new level Factories have long held a place in the popular imagination not just as sources of employment and community prosperity but also as hectic noisy grimy and polluting facilities where thousands of people are employed in largely lowskill jobs Todays factories are changing Breathtaking advances in technology automation and globalization are transforming how and where manufacturers plan construct operate and integrate their factory networks They are also ushering in significant operational political and societal changes From rust belt America to rural India and China a chorus of voices is struggling to understand How are technologies changing how we produce and distribute products Are automation and free trade taking away valuable factory jobs What type of skills will be required How can communities prosper in the face of new production technologies How and when should manufacturers upgrade their legacy equipment to embrace new technologies to boost yields and efficiency for greater profits or simply to remain competitive These are the questions weve been pondering as weve worked as a Knowledge Partner on the World Economic Forums Future of Production initiative Businesses governments and society alike must understand the technological dynamics at play and collaborate to ensure that tomorrows factory towns prosper What will the factory of the future look like The answers will come from the factory floor where new technologies like 3D printing advanced robotics the internet of things artificial intelligence wearable devices and virtual and augmented reality are converging to create new value enabling the hyperefficient and flexible factory of the future The value created is real Large global producers have increased efficiency and reduced costs by up to 30 percent across all operations driven by improvements in overall operating efficiency lower inventory energy and water costs and reduction in incidents involving safety While the pace of change and how these changes will propagate across networks will differ by industry and country the factory of the future is a more digital more virtual and more resourceefficient space It is an environment that is more connected both in terms of information availability and machines speaking to and directing each other Automation simulation visualization and analytics are deployed more widely to eliminate waste and increase efficiency in material yields energy consumption effort and time In particular factories of the future have three common overarching characteristics Digital shop floor processes that are connected automated and flexible The internet of things and connectivity combined with analytics and artificial intelligence will improve asset efficiency decrease downtime and unplanned maintenance and allow manufacturers to uncover new sources of value in services By employing digital twins simulations and virtual reality designers and operators will virtually immerse in interactive media to optimize design production processes and material flows New relationships between operators and machines Technologies are changing the nature of work and skills required from operators Robotics are automating most of the dull dirty and dangerous tasks and increasingly collaborative robots are moving out of the cage to work sidebyside with operators Augmented reality and wearables are also changing how operators train assemble and make decisions on the shop floor increasing flexibility productivity and quality Labor will actually remain costeffective in many arenas as technology allows workers to significantly improve their productivity even as overall numbers decline Some humancyber combinations will likely remain the dominant cog in factories for several years to come certainly well into the coming decade Structure location and scale of factories The factory of the future is hyperefficient and sustainable increasingly modularized with interchangeable lines that can be easily reconfigured for multiple production batches Digital production technologies will allow software developers product designers and production technicians to work in open airy environments As technology diminishes the role of lowcost labor and lowers the threshold of economies of scale distributed manufacturing will become the norm with producers augmenting their traditional production footprints with smaller and more flexible units located next to points of consumption allowing them to meet local requirements with a more responsive

on the road to recovery in recent years has been slow Global trade and investment was weaker in 2016 than in the previous year Acceleration of economic growth is the first step in promoting inclusive development Then comes sharing the achievement The best way to accelerate economic growth is to encourage global investment Investment has become a key engine of recovery Data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development says that global trade increased 27 percent yearonyear in 2015 with foreign direct investment increasing 38 percent to 17 trillion meaning that investment has become a major growth force However global investment remained slow in 2016 far less than the 2007 level of 228 trillion Foreign direct investment in 2016 is expected to come in at 15 trillion or 16 trillion or 10 to 15 percent below the 2015 level In other words the global economic recovery remains fragile at a low level of investment All of the above means we need more investment Two years ago some economists in the West complained that Chinas economic slowdown dragged down the growth of the global economy and triggered a drop in bulk commodity prices However it ignored the demand created by the rapid growth of Chinas outbound foreign investment In 2015 Chinas outbound FDI reached 1457 billion the secondlargest total in the world and outbound MA accounted for nearly 40 percent of that In 2016 outbound foreign direct investment will reach more than 170 billion according to official data and the value of Chinese corporate outbound MA will top the world according to Morning Whistle Group Nowadays complaints about Chinese economic growth have relaxed even though it has slowed further But European investment protectionalism against FDI by Chinese companies as seen in the voices of critics legislation and other measures has been increasing gradually Some MA deals were stopped because of resistance from the European countries governments or public opinion Such criticisms and complaints are baseless especially in the MA field because those deals will give both China and Western countries a better future In fact as some critics said Chinese investors came for technology Data from Morning Whistle show that 44 percent of MA deals proposed by Chinese enterprises focused on gaining advanced technologies 30 percent on gaining market channels and 10 percent on brand recognition Chinese investors paid a premium for such MAs In addition to making attractive offers the Chinese investors also brought strategic resources such as market opportunities in China to their Western partners The deals will increase jobs in both sides and bring winwin results Some Western countries insisted that those deals proposed at such high prices were supported by subsidies from the Chinese government lowinterest loans for example They didnt seem to know that about 70 percent of Chinese MA deals were proposed by private companies that more than 70 percent of Chinese MA deals were conducted by Chineselisted companies or that the high purchase prices were actually supported by Chinese private companies shareholders in a stock market whose average pricetoearnings ratio is more than double that of European companies In other words these deals deserved such values in combination with Chinese stock market valuation and actually provided a channel for Western investors or owners to share in the premium Chinese capital market It wasnt subsidies More Chinese companies tried to raise funds in overseas markets because the cost of financing is much lower than at home Chinese enterprises hope they can build capital channels and financing platforms in overseas markets to reduce their financing costs and increase their investment and financing ability Western complaints about the purchase prices offered by Chinese companies which may be very high and thus attractive to the targets come from competitors jealousy which will ultimately ruin the mutual benefits It is not fair play Chinese companies investments in overseas markets will remain strong in 2017 boosted by technological upgrades a decrease in the rate of domestic economic growth the valuation gap between China and Western stocks US Fed interest rate increases etc but growth will slow for both foreign and domestic entities Companies will pay more attention to improvements in the global value chain when proposing overseas MA deals and investment in Belt and Road countries is encouraged and supported The government didnt intend to prevent normal outbound FDI through tighter foreign exchange rules rather it aimed to improve sustainability and to prevent money laundering The pressure on both the price and volume of Chinese foreign exchange reserves can be expected to further relax in 2018 or earlier depending on the US federal interest rate cycle Structural adjustments will help So we forecast that the driving forces of growth will remain steady Europe was the first destination that abstracted Chinese investment From 2014 to 2016 the United States Britain Australia Germany South Korea and Canada topped the list of MA activity with Chinese companies The companies will take Europe as their first investment target in 2017 according to Morning Whistle We hope both sides can open their minds and cooperate well to share the China premium and other benefits We also hope Europe will remain the first choice for Chinese corporate MA activity The recovery of the world economy needs inclusive fair and green investment We hope the investments from Chinese companies will bring more opportunities to the destination countries and promote inclusive development We also noticed that the Chinese government is trying to absorb more foreign investment and giving more freedom to local governments at the beginning of 2017 We appreciate the help of Western investment in promoting Chinas economic growth over the past 30 years And we believe that Chinese investment overseas will bring a better future to the world The author is a cofounder of Morning Whistle Group The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily China Daily European

467,2017/1/6,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/06/content_27876252.htm,Foreign links key to future success,Overseas partnerships offer lucrative and beneficial opportunities for both sides says veteran consultant Many countries should look to Chinas successful record of attracting foreign investment and using it to help develop its economy a veteran consultant says Michael Enright director of the Hong Kongbased strategy consultancy Enright Scott Associates says there are some important lessons for other countries to learn from China He was in Beijing recently launching his new book DevelopingChina the Remarkable Impact of Foreign Direct Investment which demonstrates the enormous impact that FDI has on China The first lesson for other countries to learn is that foreign investment can be a very powerful engine for development Enright says Michael Enright at the launch ceremony for his new book in Beijing Provided to China Daily Second is that using foreign investment as an engine of development can be managed but a country has to develop not only capabilities in the workforce but also must develop the administrative and governmental capabilities to administer and manage a more advanced economy that includes foreigninvested enterprises The book says that FDI accounts for only a bit over 2 percent of Chinas gross capital formation But if the FDI and the operations of foreign investment enterprises and the ripple effects of the supply chains and employee spending are also counted the impact is 33 percent of Chinas GDP Enright thinks that estimate is still low He said the spillover effect of foreign investment is uncountable For example its impact on Chinese companies through the transfer of technology the adoption of modern management techniques and the training of tens of thousands of Chinese professionals through corporate training and university programs based on a Western model Foreign enterprises also help create distribution and supplier networks in China help educate tens of thousands of professionals give Chinese companies access into international markets as foreign enterprises carry 75 percent of all of Chinas international cargo bring in worldclass environmental standards and cooperate on social responsibility standards Enright says that when China started its reform and opening up in the 1980s its economy lagged behind many other countries A smart thing China did rather than trying to reinvent all the business models and technologies to develop a more advanced economy by itself was to attract good ideas and good companies from around the world to China The country has its own historical circumstances and has recognized that to develop its economy all the good ideas cannot come from one place It really needs to tap into global ideas global sources of capital and global expertise Enright says Moreover China has enormous potential with its large population as well as its skills and capabilities he says In Enrights view Chinas use of foreign capital has been managed carefully step by step to absorb foreign investment without experiencing many of the potential downsides Although there are some foreign companies that think China has not opened up enough he says any country would open only as much as it is comfortable with What most foreigners dont understand is that given Chinas unique history from the late 1950s to late 1970s included basically no foreign investment So when it started to open up it had to gradually create the necessary administrative regulatory and legal frameworks to support it But the more a country opens the more investment and highquality investment it can obtain so China should be more confident and open to additional foreign investment Enright says While foreign investment benefits China he says China has also brought many things to foreign investors One of those has been the market The stereotype outside China is that foreign companies come to China to make things with cheaper labor to send back overseas That was true in the 1980s and maybe the first half of 1990s he says But foreign companies are now primarily in China to sell to China Foreign companies sell far more in China than they export from China Enright says that China did offer relatively inexpensive labor to the world in the early days of its openingup but that is changing Increasingly multinational companies are putting RD facilities and their most advanced manufacturing facilities in China In the old days they were looking for lowcost labor Now they are looking for highly qualified labor for skilled professionals skilled scientists and that helps the companies and it helps develop the Chinese economy as well he says Foreign companies in the past made their plans based on 10 percent annual GDP growth now they have to adjust he added At the same time Chinese companies have become more experienced and can better identify their markets and use highclass technology which results in tougher competition in the domestic market Those are two main mechanisms that will cause the multinationals to rethink he says Enright says China still has great potential but many foreign companies havent realized it yet He took the Belt and Road Initiative as an example as it will cover a large population in more than 60 countries It is a massive opportunity and the potential is not only China but also Southeast Asia South Asia Central Asia and Europe because it proposes to build so much connecting infrastructure he says He says that the Chinese government has recognized that it is impossible for Chinese companies and Chinese financial institutions to do all the projects all by themselves and certain technology and expertise will be required from foreign partnerships In addition many of the places along the Belt and Road are not places where Chinese companies have experience but foreign companies do and that provides good opportunities for partnerships too But the key is To partner successfully outside China those companies also have to be partnering with the part that is inside China Enright says For Chinas Manufacturing 2025 strategy if you look at the leading technologies behind advanced manufacturing the complete factory of automation systems the internet of things machinetomachine communication systems right now the leaders in many of the technologies are outside of China he says If China really wants to develop to be the worlds leading advanced manufacturing center a lot of cooperation with foreign companies would be good and good business for the foreign companies he says He says there is a great deal of confusion in the international community because it is not clear what approach is best to get involved There is also some fear that many initiatives might be exclusive to Chinese companies so it is best if China can work out the details soon Enright says that as Chinese companies go international there will be more need of mutual understanding over the next few years about what Chinese companies are allowed to do in foreign countries and what foreign companies are allowed to do in China China became a major exporter but with relatively few Chinese companies actually understanding the international market And that is going to be one area in which working with foreign companies or allying with foreign companies is going to be critically important he says Certainly for the developing countries capital expertise and infrastructure investment from China could make major contribution to development In the more advanced countries Chinese investment is also contributing more to developing infrastructure and it is creating need jobs chenyingqunchinadailycomcn China Daily European Weekly 01062017

a wide range of opportunties Beijing Construction Engineering Group is making big strides into the UKs construction market at a time when the country requires rapid infrastructure growth The company has the advantage of extensive experience accumulated from numerous Chinese and global projects over the years It made a name for itself in the UK in 2014 by becoming one of the two contractors for Manchesters 800 million 13 billion 956 million euros Airport City Manchester project Beijing Construction Engineering Group works on the Airport City Manchester project Provided to China Daily Now it has established a solid foothold in the UK with two additional property development projects It is continuing to look for new opportunities especially infrastructure projects related to the Northern Powerhouse the UK governments program to revitalize growth in northern England through infrastructure construction which is set to become more important after Brexit We see a lot of opportunities for future expansion in the UK market Our goal is to look for suitable projects in the UK and in particular northwest England because we think the UKs Northern Powerhouse strategy will bring many opportunities says Yu Dongwen UK operations director of BCEG BCEG which was established in Beijing in 1953 already has a presence in many developing countries It expanded into Western markets in 2007 by building a hospital in Dallas Texas BCEG also worked on other projects in the US Canada and Australia Examples include a retirement home in Los Angeles and a commercial center in Australia BCEGs first project in Europe was Airport City Manchester with the company responsible for 50 percent of the construction work alongside the British contractor Carillion It is also an equity partner investing a 20 percent stake into the project Spread over an area of 465000 square meters the project includes construction of offices hotels advanced manufacturing facilities and logistics and warehousing facilities Yu says his team has already made significant progress on the basic infrastructure work for the project aiming to finish the majority of infrastructure work in 2017 It has already started designing hotels and offices for construction this year BCEGs involvement in Airport City Manchester can be traced back to 2011 when the UK and China signed an infrastructure cooperation agreement In 2013 when former prime minister David Cameron went to Beijing to promote the project BCEG was invited to bid for it as a part of a consortium We see Airport City Manchester as a first step into the UK market and an opportunity for us to gain experience and understand the UKs construction market so that we can take on bigger projects gradually and with more confidence Yu says He says experience can relate to construction methods working with local contractors and suppliers maintaining a good relationship with the British government setting up local teams and developing a working relationship with local advisers BCEGs efforts won praise from Lynda Shillaw CEO of MAG Property the property arm of Manchester Airport Group BGEG is a valuable partner in the development of Airport City and a positive example of the inward investment that is being attracted from China she says This is the first major infrastructure project in the UK with the involvement of a Chinese company as an equity partner and it demonstrates how a new wave of investment from China is transforming infrastructure and development in the UK Shillaw says After building a reputation with the Airport City Manchester project BCEG successfully started two new projects The first was Middlewood Locks a residential project that employed the Beijingbased company as a design and construction contractor The second is St Michaels a residential and commercial property development that has two tall towers and is located in the heart of Manchester near Town Hall BCEG is investing a 21 percent stake in St Michaels and is in charge of design and construction It will play a supporting role in sales by promoting the residential and office units in China Yu says BCEGs key advantages in the UK market include its competitive edge as a highly international company and its comprehensive supply chain The UK construction market is very mature It has a good legal framework and we can learn a lot of lessons here but still the amount of construction going on in the UK is nothing compared to China In Manchester for example the only tall tower in the city is the Hilton Hotel The rest of the buildings here are quite old so perhaps compared with local construction companies we have a lot of experience BCEG has worked on many recent big projects in China like the new offices of the Beijing government the headquarters of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank the APEC conference center and the Beijing New Airport among others BCEG has offices in 27 countries so it has accumulated experience from different international markets In addition it has a comprehensive supply chain We can supply our UK projects with costeffective materials which are either our own materials or materials from our existing suppliers in China Yu says He explains that many European construction firms would actually like to buy materials from China but the fact that BCEG is a Chinese company and knows the Chinese market well means it can source the most costeffective materials with the same quality In addition BCEGs role as an investment partner in some projects where it is also the contracted builder means it is able to become involved in the project at an early stage This means we can give the project owner advice on what is possible and efficient so that their initial designs are made with construction practicality in mind Then there will not be so many alterations at later stages Yu says Christopher Bovis professor of European and international business law at the University of Hull says the ability of Chinese firms like BCEG to act as both financial investors and construction contractors helps with their profitability As a financial investor they can be incentivized to improve the efficiency of the supply chain and create savings through volume so the project will generate better returns BCEGs international expansion fits into the trend of Chinese infrastructure builders going global supported by the Chinese government Examples of such companies include Liaoning Fortone a private construction business in Shenyang currently constructing two 299megawatt combined heat and power stations in Wales and China Triumph International Engineering Co which built six solar farms in the UK Yu says BCEGs internationalization strategy fits roughly into three phases which apply to many Chinese construction companies in general The first was in the 1970s when China sent many construction workers to developing nations such as parts of Africa as a part of its financial aid A lot of those first projects built according to Chinese standards and much of the construction was done by Chinese workers he says The second phase mainly happened in Southeast Asian countries before the Asian Financial Crisis The third phase happened after 2000 This third phase involved much of the expansion into developed markets such as the UK says Yu During this process we have taken on a different model of expansion In developed markets where we cannot easily second many employees we mostly rely on local partners and play the role of project managers leveraging on our experiences and management skills Looking into the future Yu says his team is keen to expand across Europe and especially in the UK He believes construction opportunities in northwestern England will not be affected by Brexitrelated uncertainties because the UK market is currently at a point where population growth is creating a large demand for property and this demand is not being met by current market supply Brexit means the UK needs to generate more growth from its own economy and the Northern Powerhouse can supply a lot of this growth The fact that many Chinese companies are interested in Northern Powerhouserelated investment opportunities means that we can play a role in leading these investments and invest alongside other Chinese companies says Yu

Honeywells CEOinwaiting Sitting in front of a roomsized aerospace simulator for pilots Darius Adamczyk president and chief operating officer of Honeywell deftly shifts from topic to topic subjects as diverse as aerospace and the companys new line of the breathable masks that help protect people during highpollution days in China His wide range of interests reflects the extraordinary range of businesses of the 40 billion 38 billion euros 324 billion technology and manufacturing giant from aerospace to electronic control technologies for buildings homes and turbochargers to highperformance materials But Adamczyk 50 who is to be the new CEO starting at the end of March is pushing for even more changes in his group He is determined to take the company to even higher heights of involvement in the digital age Darius Adamczyk CEOinwaiting of Honeywell will take office in March Provided to China Daily On his recent trips to China Adamczyk talked to his Chinese teams about how the multinational will achieve more growth by blending its strengths in hardware with a stronger presence in software in the digital age He encouraged them to create new ideas as startups rather than in an established industrial conglomerate He believes the place to achieve such breakthroughs is in China Honeywells secondlargest market after the United States Adamczyk is clear about how committed Honeywell is to the country with its major presence 13000 employees and diversified businesses in manufacturing and research and development which serves both Chinese and international markets Honeywell wants to be viewed as a local player working at the brisk performance level that has been achieved by many domestic companies he says When I think about China I cant think of a company thats more aligned to the needs of where the country is heading he says citing the key areas of energy conservation energy solutions clean air and water smart buildings chemicals and work safety Recently he spoke with China Daily about the companys strategy and business opportunities in China The following are edited excerpts from the interview Q What are your strategies for the company in the long term A No 1 is to continue to provide superior value to our customers and No 2 is to drive digitalization throughout Honeywell We have a strong presence in software but we have a lot more opportunities to drive it All aspects of our business are very customercentric I want to make sure that we operate in segments that are exciting and growing and wellaligned with mega trends How are you going to blend software programming with Honeywells existing physical products Honeywell has been developing in internet of things and we have access to data Honeywell is the company that has those products that actually generate that data However weve used that information just to make the basically functional products We now aim to integrate the data with information across the whole installation base that we have and across all our products and to think about our customers challenges differently We now have opportunities to redefine how we create new value for our customers through our software capability installation base and domain knowledge What do you think are the most challenging issues in making Honeywell more flexible and nimble in the internet era Speed is something thats going to separate the winners from losers And in this new industrial software and certainly one of the things that Im trying to enable in Honeywell its important for us to be able to operate and come up with ideas at a whole different rate of speed than ever before Whats your definition of a breakthrough Im never satisfied with the current speed of growth When we think of growth I think about it as continuing to gain a share in our core markets but also coming up with adjacent strategies that will enhance our overall growth So Im pushing and driving the organization to be more creative to think about our offerings differently to rethink what breakthrough growth means and to take the time to set metrics and expectations to make sure that happens What kind of incentives are you going to offer to your employees to be creative and develop new products and new applications I am encouraging all of our businesses to create new ideas and new organizational structures to create new small businesses I want them to operate like startups So I want to remove a lot of bureaucracy and encourage our people and businesses to embrace higherrisk higherreward breakthrough initiatives to really drive growth How do you prioritize your business portfolio to meet this goal As a new CEO takes over we can take a look at the markets we are in and the markets we are not in and optimize our operations and where we are today I really want to align our businesses towards a lot of longerterm global macro trends But most important for Honeywell we have to be in segments where you differentiate yourself by technology Honeywell is a technology company How have Honeywells Chinese operations performed in the past year and what are their prospects They continue to do very well Weve had another strong year in China and we are anticipating it to be even stronger in 2017 We have seen a recovery in some areas One of the more challenging market sectors in China has been the oil and gas segment due to whats been happening there But overall it was a very strong year in 2016 and we look forward to an even stronger 2017 You started your career as an engineer What is your advice to people making the transition from engineering to management Its the most challenging thing to make that first transition from being an engineer In my case I happened to bridge my engineering career with an MBA to go into the world of business But my advice to engineers is to take an assignment outside core engineering Because the broader understanding you have the more effectively you can make that progress Youve been praised for succeeding in every business leadership role you have ever held Whats your secret Its about having strategies having a group of people to work with and having the tactics to make sure the strategy is being executed every day every week every month every year Everybody in the organization should be able to say how they are contributing to that strategy Then its about putting the operational systems in place And people are critical What is the most important quality for a leader As a leader you have to put a lot of energy and a lot of passion into the business You have to be the spark that moves the organization Thats something that I am always trying to do I think the job of leader is to always set the bar higher to always challenge the organization What are your hobbies and interests outside of work I spend all my spare time with my family To make sure that you stay really grounded whats truly important is your family

whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture The last month of the lunar calendar used to be called the Hunting Month in more rustic times That was when traps were set in the wild to catch pheasants rabbits deer and wild boar in preparation for the rounds of feasting during the Spring Festival just weeks away These days wild game is no longer easily available so tamer options are used although the meats are still cured and hung up to dry in the chilly winds Layue has come to represent a time for preparing and curing meats known as larou Assorted cured meats form elaborate displays in markets Photos Provided to China Daily Major curing ingredients range from pig liver to poultry from beef to mutton In spite of the urban spread of Chinas population the yearend tradition of preserving meat is still popular with a variety of birds cuts of beef mutton pork and fish strung up in backyards and on balconies to catch the winter wind and sun Lets start from the southern end of the country where Cantonese cured meats form elaborate displays at New Years markets Sausages are made from handcut belly pork and marinated in salt plenty of sugar and quality Chinese yellow wine which gives the links their characteristic red tinge This is also the time when fresh duck or goose livers are marinated in spices sugar and wine and stuffed into intestines These unlike the meat sausages are seasonal delicacies only available for a limited time Another uniquely Cantonese cured product is a whole pig liver hollowed out and stuffed with a piece of pork fat Surprisingly they are not hard to eat The liver turns firm during the curing process while the fat turns crisp and transparent The Cantonese cook steams then cuts these liver sausages into very thin slivers serving them on slices of steamed arrowroot or yam More familiar are whole ducks which are spatchcocked spiced and salted The intensely savory birds will be a highlight on the reunion table on Lunar New Years Eve Surprisingly chicken is cooked fresh and seldom cured in the southern regions Duck thigh fillets are now more popular with the modern generation as traditions change with the shrinking size of families These deep maroon nuggets are easily cut up and even easier to steam and there are no bony bits to contend with Further north in Yunnan and Sichuan various cuts of meat are heavily seasoned and hung up to dry ending up in stirfries or simply steamed Here the meats are pickled with lots of chilli and Sichuan peppercorns Local sausages are also very spicy and they leach a bright red oil when they are fried sending out a fragrance that is irresistible to the homesick Sichuan native Near the central plains and the lake regions just to the south soy sauce is a major curing ingredient and saucecured strips of meat are already hanging up to dry in many backyards Poultry such as duck goose or chicken is also steeped in sauce In Ningbo a favorite New Years delicacy is a sort of ham with chopped pork stuffed into a pigs stomach and then cured in brine In Hubei where there are plenty of lakes and ponds preparation for spring must start with fishing for carp Whole carp are salted and then hung up to dehydrate but a good cured carp stays soft and supple for the New Years meals As we move farther north the nomadic influences come into play and the main ingredients change to beef and mutton and the style becomes more like jerky Whole sheep are cured and beef is cut and dried in easytotransport strips Beef jerky is still popular with horsemen driving flocks These days however they have become favorite snacks for the keyboard generation who buy them from online supermarkets that deliver to the door Strips of cured meat or tiny cubes individually wrapped are all bestsellers The Hunting Month may have slowly evolved into the curing month but it is still part of a culinary tradition that is a prelude to the most important celebration of the entire lunar year paulinedchinadailycomcn Making sausages the Cantonese way Prepare sausage casings These natural pig intestines are heavily salted to preserve them and you need to soak them for a day or two to make them supple again Once they are soft you have to gently run water through them to make sure there are no leaks I often sterilize them by pushing fat cloves of garlic down the entire length Cutting the meat The best ratio of fat to lean is about 70 percent marbled meat to 30 percent fat which must be handcut into the smallest dices It is the fat that keeps the sausages moist Marbled meat is softer with fat lacing the leaner fibers These cuts are normally on the upper shoulders and thighs Handcutting the meat is important if you want to control the texture You can mince the meat but it means a more mealy and dense sausage after curing Once the meats are prepared mix them up thoroughly so there are jewels of fat studded throughout The marinade Salt sugar and Chinese fivespice powder are dissolved in a dark soy sauce and Chinese yellow wine mixture You must be able to smell the fragrance of the wine so a quality product must be chosen I also add a couple spoonfuls of strong white liqueur to aid the preservation You can use vodka as a substitute Taste If youre happy with the balance of flavors its time to add the meat Mix it all really well and let it sit for an hour for the meat to absorb the marinade Stuffing the sausages Open up the sausage casing and push it up the narrow end of a funnel Hold on to the casing as you push the meat through the funnel If you are a beginner work on shorter more manageable lengths Always check that your sausages are not split or leaking Twist them into the lengths you want and then hang them on a bamboo pole You can cure them on the balcony where the cold will soon dry them up Remember to place a tray beneath the links to catch the dripping fat otherwise your neighborhood pets will soon be congregating on your balcony or in your backyard The links will be wrinkled and ready in about three weeks and you can then transfer them to the refrigerator Steam them or cut them up to fry China

have unintended but farreaching consequences In recent years the treatment of pregnant patients has become an increasingly thorny task for Liu Wenxian a cardiologist at Anzhen Hospital in Beijing as a result of the rise in the number of older women wanting to give birth Many of these women are from outside Beijing and have risky complications such as cardiac disease she says The problem has worsened since the adoption of the universal twochild policy because such complications are more commonly seen in pregnant women who have given birth before In many cases especially when the patients condition is critical we have to reevaluate their decision to have a baby and end the pregnancy promptly to save their life Motherstobe practice yoga at a training institute in Nanchang Jiangxi province Photos by Xinhua Pregnant women line up for health checks at Jinan Maternity and Child Care Hospital in Jinan Shandong province in March Thirty percent of motherstobe visiting the hospital are expecting their second child according to hospital sources Gu Hong a pediatrician at the hospital who specializes in treating cardiac disease in babies warns that the twochild policy could have unintended but farreaching consequences We are facing some very harsh challenges Many women are trying their best to have a second child even if conditions such as cardiac disease could put them at high risk According to Gu seven pregnant women have died in the hospital in the past five years as a result of cardiac complications and those risks still exist despite improvements in medical technology Anzhen Hospital is not alone in facing the challenge According to the National Health and Family Planning Commission in the first half of the year Chinas maternity mortality rate reached 183 per 1 million people an increase of more than 30 percent compared with the same period last year The mortality rate had been declining steadily in China until the end of last year when the countrys leaders approved the adoption of the universal twochild policy to tackle the problems posed by the nations rapidly aging population As a result the decadeslong family planning policy which limited most couples to one child was relaxed Last year the mortality rate during pregnancy fell to 201 per 1 million people from 300 per 1 million in 2010 according to the commission But the figure is now rising The rise in the number of pregnant women particularly those at higher risk such as older women resulted in a rise in maternity deaths in some parts of the country in the first half of the year a statement released by the commission in October said The NHFPC estimates that more than 3 million women at higher risk will become pregnant in China every year between the start of next year and 2020 a rise of 30 percent from the period before the adoption of the twochild policy This will cause increased risks of maternity complications and present challenges to treatment and recovery the commission said The number of babies born in the first half of the year was 831 million a rise of 69 percent over the same period last year a significant increase despite the declining number of married women of fertile age it said In addition the sudden rise in pregnancies has resulted in maternity services coming under greater strain and both facilities and hospital personnel are underresourced according to the commission Of the 90 million women now eligible to have a second baby 60 percent are 35 or older which means they are considered to be at higher risk during pregnancy the NHFPC says Gu says about 150 pregnant patients with cardiac complications were received by Anzhen Hospital last year compared with approximately 110 in 2011 This year the number is expected to surpass 180 Acting on traditional beliefs many women are opting to have another child according to Gu Many of these patients are seeking treatment and care in our hospital but not all women are suitable for pregnancy Women with serious conditions are very likely to give birth to an unhealthy child and their own lives could also be threatened during childbirth Liu the cardiologist urged older women to assess the risks they face before deciding to have a child With the rise in age pregnant women have a higher chance of developing illnesses They must be aware of their physical condition before pregnancy to reduce the risk to them during childbirth she says He Wenjie a gynecologist at the reproductive medicine department at Xuzhou Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital in Xuzhou Jiangsu province has also seen a rise in the number of older patients The average age of patients I am receiving is rising It is crucial that all women especially those who are older have checkups before pregnancy to reduce the health risk The NHFPC says health authorities will take more measures in the next few years to improve the health of pregnant women given the rising rates of mortality during pregnancy Hospitals nationwide will add 89000 obstetrics beds and local authorities will upgrade emergency equipment at hospital obstetrics and pediatrics departments The commission will also select a number of national midwifery training bases and organize training related to the treatment of pregnant women with critical conditions It will also cooperate with other departments to provide training with the aim of producing 140000 extra obstetricians and midwives wangxiaodongchinadailycomcn China Daily European Weekly 01062017 page20
488,2017/1/6,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/06/content_27876226.htm,You know where you are with province names,Titles of Chinese regions are mostly based on logic and geography If there is one quality a good administrator of an empire ought to have its knowing where everything is In early history the tribes that were the forerunners of the Chinese civilization called their homeland the Central Plains defined as the plains in the center of the various tribes that surrounded them This name later gave rise to the term zhōnggu�� or Central Kingdom the literal translation of the name of said civilization The names of many Chinese administrative regions today retain helpful references to directions and geographic features to let you know roughly where they are for instance south of the river or north of the river Easy Henan 河南 H��n��n Hebei 河北 H��běi Hunan 湖南，Hún��n Hubei 湖北，Húběi Shandong 山东 Shāndōng Shanxi 山西 shānxī First brush up on your cardinal directions ��dōng east ��xī west ��n��n south ��běi north ��h�� refers to river ��hú is lake and ��shān is mountains But actually in ancient times ��was the exclusive name of the Yellow River the major river of consequence in northern China whereas your runofthemill tributaries streams channels conduits and waterways would have all been referred to as ��chuān as in Sichuan four rivers That more or less gives away the answer to the first pair of provinces Henan and Hebei are regions and later provinces north and south of the Yellow River Hunan and Hubei are likewise north and south of the lake which in this case is Dongting Lake The mountains referred to in Shandong and Shanxi on the other hand are open to some dispute They could refer to the Taihang Mountains which are located between Shanxi and Hebei province but not presentday Shandong Xiao Mountain in presentday Henan province or Mount Hua in Shanxi It could also refer to all of these mountains as up until the Qing dynasty Shandong referred to a much larger region roughly comprising the plains around the eastern section of the Yellow River east of the mountains generally speaking that were found north of the Central Plains Moderate Guangxi 广西 Guǎngxī Guangdong 广东 Guǎngdōng Jiangxi 江西 Jiāngxī These province names also include cardinal directions but no clear geographic marker The ��guǎng in Guangxi Autonomous Region and Guangdong province literally means wide but the name of the region traces itself to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty in the 2nd century BC During his reign the Han conquered the southern kingdom of Nanyue 南越 also known as Southern Yue focused around the presentday city of Guangzhou According to ancient historians at this time Emperor Wu said 初开粤地宜广布恩��as we develop the Yue region we must widely broadcast favor and trust The characters ��and ��quote gave rise to the name to the new regional capital Guangxin and the entire region of presentday Guangdong and Guangxi came to be called Guangzhou after this city In the Song Dynasty 9601279 the road leading to this region had two branches called Guangxi South Road and Guangdong South Road which gave the two presentday administrative regions their names Jiangxi also has many confusing explanations In ancient times the character ��jiāng for river belonged like ��exclusively to one river which in this case is the Yangtze River 长江 ch��ngjiāng Since the Yangtze actually flows through presentday Jiangxi province it would make sense that Jiangxi refers to the western part of the Yangtze except Jiangxi is actually located quite far east Some other explanations are that the ��actually refers to the ��gàn River another major river in the province The real answer is that Jiangxi is an abbreviation for 江南西部 jiāngn��n xībù or western part of the Jiangnan region the name given to the geographic and cultural area immediately south of the Yangtze Hard Shaanxi 陕西 Shǎnxī Yunnan 云南 Yúnn��n Hainan 海南 Hǎin��n Tibet 西藏，Xīzàng Like Jiangxi the names of these provinces and regions also lack a direct counterpart However unlike Jiangxi the reason here is that these names all refer to former Chinese border regions and are named according to their cardinal direction relative to some description of Chinas borders highlighting their status outside the ancient definition of the homeland their counterpart would simply be existing Chinese regions that already had names or more broadly China itself Shaanxi currently home to Xian the former imperial capital of Changan was integrated into the central Chinese civilization early on However the name of the region comes from its location west of the Shaan Plateau 陕塬 shǎnyu��n in presentday Shaan county Henan province and was decidedly a frontier region of the Western Zhou Dynasty c11th century771 BC which was based around the Central Plains In around the 9th century BC the region became the seat of the Qin Kingdom one of the Warring States which was considered by the other states to be a western borderregion upstart beneath their notice As we now know the Qin exploited this advantage and conquered all the other states to become the Qin Empire the first Chinese empire and with this the former frontier of Shaanxi and the Qin capital of Changan became the new Chinese heartland The names of Yunnan and Hainan both connote places that in ancient times were really incredibly unimaginably far away Yunnan literally means South of the Clouds and that is the actual origin of the name it was the mysterious region south of the cloudshrouded mountains that marked the southwestern boundary of the ancient Chinese civilization but a more colorful legend states that one day Emperor Wu of Han saw iridescent clouds on top of a mountain and ordered his servant to follow it When the servant reported back that he found land south of those clouds Emperor Wu named it Yunnan Hainan on the other hand comes from Hainan Island and the name means South of the Sea and was among many folk names that the island used to go by in ancient times including southern extremity 南极 n��nj�� edge of the sea 海角 hǎijiǎo and edge of the sky 天涯 tiāny�� Xizang finally has several explanations the character ��zàng itself is said to be a transliteration of a Tibetan word for the region populated by the Tibetan ethnic group which also included presentday parts of Sichuan and Qinghai provinces Xi however comes from a slightly different origin as part of the general name that Chinese empires since the Yuan Dynasty 12711368 gave to their western border regions 西域 xīyù Expert level Guandong 关东 Guāndōng all provincial abbreviations Guandong not to be confused with Guangdong was the old name for the northeastern region of China which in English today is still called Manchuria a name first created by French missionaries The name referred to the regions position east but mostly north of the passes on the Great Wall through which the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty 16361912 eventually entered China and integrated the region into the Chinese homeland Courtesy of The World of Chinese wwwtheworldofchinesecom The World of Chinese China Daily European Weekly

489,2017/1/6,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/06/content_27876225.htm,Building a giant reputation,An architect ahead of his time selfdescribed rebel Wang Shu struggled for years with no commissions before going on to win the coveted Pritzker Prize When officials of Fuyang approached Wang Shu in 2012 to ask him to design an arts center the Pritzker Prizewinning architect had a rather unusual condition He wanted to have a hand in designing homes for local villages as well Fuyang is located about an hours drive from Hangzhou Zhejiang province and sits on the north bank of the Fuchun River a place renowned for its natural beauty Earlier this year it became a district under the city of Hangzhou A view of the roof of the Gongwang Art Museum The building is part of an arts complex that houses an archive and another museum The architecture of the Gongwang Art Museum blends traditional Chinese elements with modern aesthetics Photos Provided to China Daily The local administration promptly agreed to Wangs request The prospect of securing the services of this famous figure in the architecture world was reason enough to do so In a display of just how much they revered Wang the local authorities dedicated a prime piece of land near a mountain and by a river for the arts center Should that piece of land in this location be used for real estate development today it would be valued at a staggering 1 billion yuan 150 million 1426 billion euros 51215 billion Such was Wangs influence The arts center will comprise three buildings Gongwang Art Museum Fuyang Archives and Fuyang Museum all of which will be designed by Wang The Gongwang Art Museum is already open to public while the other two segments are still under construction Wang 53 is the first Chinese person to win the worlds top prize in architecture Based in Hangzhou Zhejiang province he is currently dean of the School of Architecture at the China Academy of Art A lover of traditional art Wang grew up in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region where his mother worked as a schoolteacher During the cultural revolution 196676 when schools across the country were shuttered teachers and many others were forced to become farmers As a young boy Wang enjoyed working in the fields as it enabled him to feel a connection with the earth He said that he also found fulfillment in physical labor Wang loved reading and had fortuitous access to a range of books censored by the government when his mother was transferred from the fields to become a librarian When he was 10 Wang moved to Xian Shaanxi province where tents were used as classrooms He later witnessed how the locals would build new classrooms and was fascinated with the bamboo frameworks used in the construction process As Wang was passionate about art and engineering he decided to study architecture at Southeast University because he thought the discipline was a perfect blend of the two He describes himself as a rebellious undergraduate who was always ready to challenge professors Wang even wrote a thesis criticizing modern Chinese architecture A keen lover of traditional Chinese art with a particular interest in ancient gardens and landscape paintings Wang was eager to incorporate the aesthetics and building techniques of such places into his own creations But he was perhaps too far ahead of his time because no one on Chinas architectural scene acknowledged or understood his ideas For several years following his graduation Wang had no commissions to work on He said it was his wife Lu Wenyu who smoothed the rough edges of his personality In 1997 the two of them founded the Amateur Architecture Studio In his new book How To Build House Wang pays tribute to his wife conceding that for the first seven years of our married life it was her who supported me The couple lived an idyllic life in Hangzhou where they would often stroll along West Lake and had plenty of time to spend sipping tea with friends Wang says this calming experience nurtured his heart and in turn evoked a change in his perspective on life You could spend a long time watching the rain how it falls along the ridges of a building how the streams flow and where the water drops All this interests you You would be thinking if it is possible to design architecture and show clearly where the rain comes from where it flows where it goes each turn and change in movement touches ones heart he says Wangs unique style was eventually recognized and he was presented with the opportunity to design the Ningbo Museum in Zhejiang province Construction of the museum which featured the use of bricks salvaged from old buildings that were demolished to make way for modern developments took place between 2004 and 2008 Wang said he approached the structure as if creating a landscape painting Looking at the museum from afar you see the building as a painting of a mountain that is spreading out right in front of your eyes When entering the structure youll find different landscapes at different positions offering different perspectives This is how traditional Chinese landscape paintings should be experienced through free shifts of perspective and angles Wang says After this project Wang was a part of the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai for which he designed the Tengtou Village Pavilion inspired by a painting of a mountain dwelling by Chen Hongshou 15991652 He says that stepping into the doorway of the pavilion is akin to entering a cave where different landscapes unfold at every step like a page in an ancient leaflet of small paintings Wang also gained international recognition for designing a building on the Xiangshan Campus of the China Art Academy in suburban Hangzhou In 2012 Wang received the accolade that most people in his profession can only dream of He won the Pritzker Architecture Prize The Pritzker jury praised his unique ability to evoke the past without making direct references to history while calling his work timeless deeply rooted in its context and yet universal Wang describes his approach as a combination of ancient aesthetics with modern utility As an architect working in contemporary China he believes that one has the opportunity to create something great something lasting longer than his own life span For the Fuyang project Wang was determined to reignite the ancient Chinese admiration for mountains and rivers which embodies a unique Chinese philosophy about seeking a life that is in harmony with nature This was why he specified his unusual condition about designing homes for local villagers Together with employees from Amateur Architecture Studio and students from the China Art Academy Wang visited 290 villages in the area to inspect old houses and become immersed in the traditional way of life He says that nature plays an integral role in the simple yet charming way of life in such areas which is today on the verge of extinction He laments how many of the homes being built in the country today are soulless Americanstyle big villas or fake antiques with white walls and gray tiles Wang used the smaller residential structures in the village as a canvas for experimentating with ideas He used stones old tiles and materials usually considered worthless to construct new village homes and this process helped him determine what he would do for the design of the Gongwang Art Museum While the museum might be large its imposing size is tempered by the roofs long and soft curves which are reminiscent of the mountain ridges in the distance But not everyone is in awe of Wangs creations Some have raised concerns about leakage issues high maintenance and how his buildings are too distinctive in style drawing attention away from the exhibits on display However Li Lei director of China Art Museum Shanghai begs to differ saying that a fine piece of architecture of the kind Wang has created is a bold challenge to pragmatism The building itself is a piece of art Apart from the skyscrapers that are mushrooming all over China the country needs architecture for aesthetic appreciation and spiritual fulfillment too says Li As the nations ideas develop in tandem with economic growth there will be cultural awakening and people will soon be able to appreciate great architecture zhangkunchinadailycomcn China Daily European Weekly 01062017 page21

496,2017/1/6,http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-01/06/content_27876160.htm,Innovation requires tolerance of failure,Chinas stateowned enterprises are administered by governments at various levels The number of those monitored by the StateOwned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council stands at 103 after years of streamlining efforts But as shown in the recently issued Outline of Central Governmentled Enterprises 13th FiveYear Development Plan they are saddled with great responsibility in achieving innovationdriven development in a bid to help realize the countrys goal of power through innovation In fact in recent years based on some inherent technology advantages central governmentled enterprises have continuously refreshed the innovation record For example scientists have utilized aerospace plasma technology to overcome the lean coal ignition problem China National Offshore Oil Corp completed its first highyield well test in 2015 and the Shenzhou11 spacecraft solar wing was 100 percent made in China The RD input by central governmentled enterprises has exceeded 25 percent of Chinas total which is already responsible for more than 2 percent of its GDP In 2015 central governmentled enterprises won 86 National Science and Technology Awards or 34 percent of the total However they still have a long way to go The outline has raised a new goal for the enterprises continuously optimizing the structure of stateowned capital substantively improving the enterprises innovationdriven development capacity cultivating a group of multinational corporations with innovation capacity and boosting international competitiveness Compared with the multinationals in developed countries the Chinese enterprises lack strong inhouse innovation Many in developed countries have largescale RD institutes and a large number of personnel The RD input remains at a high level Take Dupont for instance The company had Charles J Pederson winner of Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1987 in its innovation lab Because of the comparative weakness of the inhouse system central governmentled enterprises in China are in short of originality and innovative capabilities Right now a large proportion of RD capacity in China is confined to universities and research institutions rather than being possessed by enterprises For future innovation capacity building China needs to adjust the distribution of RD resources transferring more to enterprises Otherwise the country may get a lot of RD output but without harvesting the fruits of innovation Since the reform and openingup policy was adopted China has developed into the worlds factory and has achieved fast economic growth The technology progress pattern of this round of fast economic development was technology importation assimilation and reinnovation Most of the innovation activities carried out by large governmentled enterprises such as China Railway Corp China Mobile China National Petroleum Corp and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp followed this trajectory However while the technology gap between China and developed countries is continuously narrowing the previous pattern of technology progress will not be sustainable If Chinese enterprises cannot upgrade from technology follower to innovation leader it can be foreseen that they will fall into a trap in the technology race that is while they may approach the high technology level through the old learning pattern once a new technology field comes into being they will find themselves on the ebb again Therefore at present the governmentled enterprises face a new innovation goal with internal and external challenges Furthermore the previous innovation trajectory needs to be overhauled as the country enters a new round in global technology competition Notably the Chinese government has provided strong policy support to its enterprises including the Interim Incentive Measures on Equity and the Dividend for the Stateowned Science and Technology Enterprises But while a supporting political environment is in place the enterprises still need to make efforts from within to change conventional thinking and behavior and cultivate an innovation culture They need to develop a culture that tolerates failure Original innovation progresses by drawing from failures However the governmentled enterprises do not have such a culture which means few projects can be terminated halfway Nowadays a newborn innovation model iterative innovation which pushes semimature products to the market and then continuously improves them based on market feedback has been adopted by some industries that are in highly uncertain and competitive positions This new model is flexible and effective bringing many enterprises to a position of advantage in an environment of furious competition Central governmentled enterprises can hardly embrace this innovation model without rejecting the current management model and creating a new mindset that bravely faces and utilizes failures in the course of technology advancement Meanwhile the enterprises need to develop a culture that dares to put innovative RD personnel at center stage When they plan projects RD personnel are not in a position to make their own decisions Therefore the incentives and enthusiasm for original innovation are not in place within the enterprises The ice of bureaucratic hierarchy and authority division should be broken opening smooth channels for innovation activities In an era of globalized innovation manufacturing activities will no longer be high valueadded Chinese enterprises developed strong manufacturing capacity in the past which supported industrialization However it only brought China to the starting line in the new competitive global race and cannot guarantee winning the medal for technology power Central governmentled enterprises need a more risktaking innovation culture putting innovation first on their agenda They need innovation multitasking to realize the transformation mission Liu Xielin is dean of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Research Centre at University of
